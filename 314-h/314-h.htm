<h2>
    A Preface With Some Revised Ideas
</h2>
<p>
IT HAS BEEN ten years since I wrote the prefatory "Declaration" to this
now enlarged and altered book. Not to my generation alone have many
things receded during that decade. To the intelligent young as well as
to the intelligent elderly, efforts in the present atmosphere to opiate
the public with mere pictures of frontier enterprise have a ghastly
unreality. The Texas Rangers have come to seem as remote as the
Foreign Legion in France fighting against the Kaiser. Yet this <i>Guide</i>,
extensively added to and revised, is mainly concerned, apart from the
land and its native life, with frontier backgrounds. If during a decade
a man does not change his mind on some things and develop new points of
view, it is a pretty good sign that his mind is petrified and need no
longer be accounted among the living. I have an inclination to rewrite
the "Declaration," but maybe I was just as wise on some matters ten
years ago as I am now; so I let it stand.
</p>
<pre>
          Do I contradict myself?
          Very well then I contradict myself.
</pre>
<p>
I have heard so much silly bragging by Texans that I now think it would
be a blessing to themselves&mdash;and a relief to others&mdash;if the braggers did
not know they lived in Texas. Yet the time is not likely to come when
a human being will not be better adapted to his environments by knowing
their nature; on the other hand, to study a provincial setting from a
provincial point of view is restricting. Nobody should specialize on
provincial writings before he has the perspective that only a good deal
of good literature and wide history can give. I think it more important
that a dweller in the Southwest read <i>The Trial and Death of Socrates</i>
than all the books extant on killings by Billy the Kid. I think this
dweller will fit his land better by understanding Thomas Jefferson's
oath ("I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against
every form of tyranny over the mind of man") than by reading all the
books that have been written on ranch lands and people. For any dweller
of the Southwest who would have the land soak into him, Wordsworth's
"Tintern Abbey," "Ode: Intimations of Immortality," "The Solitary
Reaper," "Expostulation and Reply," and a few other poems are more
conducive to a "wise passiveness" than any native writing.
</p>
<p>
There are no substitutes for nobility, beauty, and wisdom. One of the
chief impediments to amplitude and intellectual freedom is provincial
inbreeding. I am sorry to see writings of the Southwest substituted for
noble and beautiful and wise literature to which all people everywhere
are inheritors. When I began teaching "Life and Literature of the
Southwest" I did not regard these writings as a substitute. To reread
most of them would be boresome, though <i>Hamlet</i>, Boswell's <i>Johnson</i>,
Lamb's <i>Essays</i>, and other genuine literature remain as quickening as
ever.
</p>
<p>
Very likely I shall not teach the course again. I am positive I shall
never revise this <i>Guide</i> again. It is in nowise a bibliography. I have
made more additions to the "Range Life" chapter than to any other. I
am a collector of such books. A collector is a person who gathers unto
himself the worthless as well as the worthy. Since I did not make a
nickel out of the original printing of the <i>Guide</i> and hardly expect to
make enough to buy a California "ranch" out of the present printing,
I have added several items, with accompanying remarks, more for my own
pleasure than for benefit to society.
</p>
<p>
Were the listings halved, made more selective, the book might serve
its purpose better. Anybody who wants to can slice it in any manner
he pleases. I am as much against forced literary swallowings as I am
against prohibitions on free tasting, chewing, and digestion. I rate
censors, particularly those of church and state, as low as I rate
character assassins; they often run together.
</p>
<p>
I'd like to make a book on <i>Emancipators of the Human Mind</i>&mdash;Emerson,
Jefferson, Thoreau, Tom Paine, Newton, Arnold, Voltaire, Goethe.... When
I reflect how few writings connected with the wide open spaces of
the West and Southwest are wide enough to enter into such a volume, I
realize acutely how desirable is perspective in patriotism.
</p>
<p>
Hundreds of the books listed in this <i>Guide</i> have given me pleasure as
well as particles for the mosaic work of my own books; but, with minor
exceptions, they increasingly seem to me to explore only the exteriors
of life. There is in them much good humor but scant wit. The hunger for
something afar is absent or battened down. Drought blasts the turf, but
its unhealing blast to human hope is glossed over. The body's thirst for
water is a recurring theme, but human thirst for love and just thinking
is beyond consideration. Horses run with their riders to death or
victory, but fleeting beauty haunts no soul to the "doorway of the
dead." The land is often pictured as lonely, but the lone way of a human
being's essential self is not for this extravert world. The banners of
individualism are carried high, but the higher individualism that grows
out of long looking for meanings in the human drama is negligible.
Somebody is always riding around or into a "feudal domain." Nobody at
all penetrates it or penetrates democracy with the wisdom that came to
Lincoln in his loneliness: "As I would not be a SLAVE, so I would not
be a MASTER. This expresses my idea of democracy. Whatever differs from
this, to the extent of the difference, is no democracy." The mountains,
the caves, the forests, the deserts have had no prophets to interpret
either their silences or their voices. In short, these books are mostly
only the stuff of literature, not literature itself, not the very stuff
of life, not the distillations of mankind's "agony and bloody sweat."
</p>
<p>
An ignorant person attaches more importance to the chatter of small
voices around him than to the noble language of remote individuals. The
more he listens to the small, the smaller he grows. The hope of regional
literature lies in out-growing regionalism itself. On November 11, 1949,
I gave a talk to the Texas Institute of Letters that was published in
the Spring 1950 issue of the <i>Southwest Review</i>. The paragraphs that
follow are taken therefrom.
</p>
<p>
Good writing about any region is good only to the extent that it
has universal appeal. Texans are the only "race of people" known to
anthropologists who do not depend upon breeding for propagation. Like
princes and lords, they can be made by "breath," plus a big white
hat&mdash;which comparatively few Texans wear. A beef stew by a cook in San
Antonio, Texas, may have a different flavor from that of a beef stew
cooked in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but the essential substances of
potatoes and onions, with some suggestion of beef, are about the same,
and geography has no effect on their digestibility.
</p>
<p>
A writer&mdash;a regional writer, if that term means anything&mdash;will whenever
he matures exercise the critical faculty. I mean in the Matthew Arnold
sense of appraisal rather than of praise, or, for that matter, of
absolute condemnation. Understanding and sympathy are not eulogy. Mere
glorification is on the same intellectual level as silver tongues and
juke box music.
</p>
<p>
In using that word INTELLECTUAL, one lays himself liable to the
accusation of having forsaken democracy. For all that, "fundamental
brainwork" is behind every respect-worthy piece of writing, whether it
be a lightsome lyric that seems as careless as a redbird's flit or a
formal epic, an impressionistic essay or a great novel that measures the
depth of human destiny. Nonintellectual literature is as nonexistent
as education without mental discipline, or as "character building" in a
school that is slovenly in scholarship. Billboards along the highways of
Texas advertise certain towns and cities as "cultural centers." Yet no
chamber of commerce would consider advertising an intellectual center.
The culture of a nineteenth-century finishing school for young ladies
was divorced from intellect; genuine civilization is always informed
by intellect. The American populace has been taught to believe that
the more intellectual a professor is, the less common sense he has;
nevertheless, if American democracy is preserved it will be preserved by
thought and not by physics.
</p>
<p>
Editors of all but a few magazines of the country and publishers of most
of the daily newspapers cry out for brightness and vitality and at the
same time shut out critical ideas. They want intellect, but want it
petrified. Happily, the publishers of books have not yet reached that
form of delusion. In an article entitled "What Ideas Are Safe?" in
the <i>Saturday Review of Literature</i> for November 5, 1949, Henry Steele
Commager says:
</p>
<p>
If we establish a standard of safe thinking, we will end up with no
thinking at all.... We cannot... have thought half slave and half
free.... A nation which, in the name of loyalty or of patriotism or of
any sincere and high-sounding ideal, discourages criticism and dissent,
and puts a premium on acquiescence and conformity, is headed for
disaster.
</p>
<p>
Unless a writer feels free, things will not come to him, he cannot
burgeon on any subject whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
In 1834 Davy Crockett's <i>Autobiography</i> was published. It is one of
the primary social documents of America. It is as much Davy Crockett,
whether going ahead after bears in a Tennessee canebrake or going ahead
after General Andrew Jackson in Congress, as the equally plain but also
urbane <i>Autobiography</i> of Franklin is Benjamin Franklin. It is undiluted
regionalism. It is provincial not only in subject but in point of view.
</p>
<p>
No provincial mind of this day could possibly write an autobiography or
any other kind of book co-ordinate in value with Crockett's "classic in
homespun." In his time, Crockett could exercise intelligence and still
retain his provincial point of view. Provincialism was in the air over
his land. In these changed times, something in the ambient air prevents
any active intelligence from being unconscious of lands, peoples,
struggles far beyond any province.
</p>
<p>
Not long after the Civil War, in Harris County, Texas, my father heard a
bayou-billy yell out:
</p>
<pre>
 Whoopee! Raised in a canebrake and suckled by a she-bear!
 The click of a six-shooter is music to my ear!
 The further up the creek you go, the worse they git,
 And I come from the head of it! Whoopee!
</pre>
<p>
If it were now possible to find some section of country so far up above
the forks of the creek that the owls mate there with the chickens, and
if this section could send to Congress one of its provincials untainted
by the outside world, he would, if at all intelligent, soon after
arriving on Capitol Hill become aware of interdependencies between his
remote province and the rest of the world.
</p>
<p>
Biographies of regional characters, stories turning on local customs,
novels based on an isolated society, books of history and fiction going
back to provincial simplicity will go on being written and published.
But I do not believe it possible that a good one will henceforth come
from a mind that does not in outlook transcend the region on which it
is focused. That is not to imply that the processes of evolution have
brought all parts of the world into such interrelationships that a
writer cannot depict the manners and morals of a community up Owl Hoot
Creek without enmeshing them with the complexities of the Atlantic
Pact. Awareness of other times and other wheres, not insistence on that
awareness, is the requisite. James M. Barrie said that he could not
write a play until he got his people off on a kind of island, but had he
not known about the mainland he could never have delighted us with the
islanders&mdash;islanders, after all, for the night only. Patriotism of the
right kind is still a fine thing; but, despite all gulfs, canyons, and
curtains that separate nations, those nations and their provinces are
all increasingly interrelated.
</p>
<p>
No sharp line of time or space, like that separating one century from
another or the territory of one nation from that of another, can delimit
the boundaries of any region to which any regionalist lays claim.
Mastery, for instance, of certain locutions peculiar to the Southwest
will take their user to the Aztecs, to Spain, and to the border of
ballads and Sir Walter Scott's romances. I found that I could not
comprehend the coyote as animal hero of Pueblo and Plains Indians apart
from the Reynard of Aesop and Chaucer.
</p>
<p>
In a noble opinion respecting censorship and freedom of the press,
handed down on March 18, 1949, Judge Curtis Bok of Pennsylvania said:
</p>
<p>
It is no longer possible that free speech be guaranteed Federally and
denied locally; under modern methods of instantaneous communication
such a discrepancy makes no sense.... What is said in Pennsylvania may
clarify an issue in California, and what is suppressed in California may
leave us the worse in Pennsylvania. Unless a restriction on free speech
be of national validity, it can no longer have any local validity
whatever.
</p>
<p>
Among the qualities that any good regional writer has in common with
other good writers of all places and times is intellectual integrity.
Having it does not obligate him to speak out on all issues or, indeed,
on any issue. He alone is to judge whether he will sport with
Amaryllis in the shade or forsake her to write his own <i>Areopagitica</i>.
Intellectual integrity expresses itself in the tune as well as argument,
in choice of words&mdash;words honest and precise&mdash;as well as in ideas, in
fidelity to human nature and the flowers of the fields as well as to
principles, in facts reported more than in deductions proposed. Though a
writer write on something as innocuous as the white snails that crawl
up broomweed stalks and that roadrunners carry to certain rocks to
crack and eat, his intellectual integrity, if he has it, will infuse the
subject.
</p>
<p>
Nothing is too trivial for art, but good art treats nothing in a trivial
way. Nothing is too provincial for the regional writer, but he cannot
be provincial-minded toward it. Being provincial-minded may make him a
typical provincial; it will prevent him from being a representative
or skilful interpreter. Horace Greeley said that when the rules of the
English language got in his way, they did not stand a chance. We may be
sure that if by violating the rules of syntax Horace Greeley sometimes
added forcefulness to his editorials, he violated them deliberately and
not in ignorance. Luminosity is not stumbled into. The richly savored
and deliciously unlettered speech of Thomas Hardy's rustics was the
creation of a master architect who had looked out over the ranges of
fated mankind and looked also into hell. Thomas Hardy's ashes were
placed in Westminster Abbey, but his heart, in accordance with a
provision of his will, was buried in the churchyard of his own village.
</p>
<p>
I have never tried to define regionalism. Its blanket has been put
over a great deal of worthless writing. Robert Frost has approached a
satisfying conception. "The land is always in my bones," he said&mdash;the
land of rock fences. But, "I am not a regionalist. I am a realmist. I
write about realms of democracy and realms of the spirit." Those realms
include The Woodpile, The Grindstone, Blueberries, Birches, and many
other features of the land North of Boston.
</p>
<p>
To an extent, any writer anywhere must make his own world, no matter
whether in fiction or nonfiction, prose or poetry. He must make
something out of his subject. What he makes depends upon his creative
power, integrated with a sense of form. The popular restriction of
creative writing to fiction and verse is illogical. Carl Sandburg's life
of Lincoln is immeasurably more creative in form and substance than his
fanciful <i>Potato Face</i>. Intense exercise of his creative power sets,
in a way, the writer apart from the life he is trying to sublimate.
Becoming a Philistine will not enable a man to interpret Philistinism,
though Philistines who own big presses think so. Sinclair Lewis knew
Babbitt as Babbitt could never know either himself or Sinclair Lewis.

<h2>
    1. A Declaration
</h2>
<p>
IN THE UNIVERSITY of Texas I teach a course called "Life and Literature
of the Southwest." About 1929 I had a brief guide to books concerning
the Southwest mimeographed; in 1931 it was included by John William
Rogers in a booklet entitled <i>Finding Literature on the Texas Plains</i>.
After that I revised and extended the guide three or four times, during
the process distributing several thousand copies of the mimeographed
forms. Now the guide has grown too long, and I trust that this printing
of it will prevent my making further additions&mdash;though within a short
time new books will come out that should be added.
</p>
<p>
Yet the guide is fragmentary, incomplete, and in no sense a
bibliography. Its emphases vary according to my own indifferences and
ignorance as well as according to my own sympathies and knowledge. It is
strong on the character and ways of life of the early settlers, on the
growth of the soil, and on everything pertaining to the range; it is
weak on information concerning politicians and on citations to studies
which, in the manner of orthodox Ph.D. theses, merely transfer bones
from one graveyard to another.
</p>
<p>
It is designed primarily to help people of the Southwest see
significances in the features of the land to which they belong, to make
their environments more interesting to them, their past more alive,
to bring them to a realization of the values of their own cultural
inheritance, and to stimulate them to observe. It includes most of
the books about the Southwest that people in general would agree on as
making good reading.
</p>
<p>
I have never had any idea of writing or teaching about my own section
of the country merely as a patriotic duty. Without apologies, I would
interpret it because I love it, because it interests me, talks to me,
appeals to my imagination, warms my emotions; also because it seems to
me that other people living in the Southwest will lead fuller and richer
lives if they become aware of what it holds. I once thought that, so
far as reading goes, I could live forever on the supernal beauty of
Shelley's "The Cloud" and his soaring lines "To a Skylark," on the rich
melancholy of Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale," on Cyrano de Bergerac's
ideal of a free man, on Wordsworth's philosophy of nature&mdash;a philosophy
that has illuminated for me the mesquite flats and oak-studded hills of
Texas&mdash;on the adventures in Robert Louis Stevenson, the flavor and wit
of Lamb's essays, the eloquent wisdom of Hazlitt, the dark mysteries
of Conrad, the gaieties of Barrie, the melody of Sir Thomas Browne, the
urbanity of Addison, the dash in Kipling, the mobility, the mightiness,
the lightness, the humor, the humanity, the everything of Shakespeare,
and a world of other delicious, high, beautiful, and inspiring things
that English literature has bestowed upon us. That literature is still
the richest of heritages; but literature is not enough.
</p>
<p>
Here I am living on a soil that my people have been living and working
and dying on for more than a hundred years&mdash;the soil, as it happens,
of Texas. My roots go down into this soil as deep as mesquite roots go.
This soil has nourished me as the banks of the lovely Guadalupe River
nourish cypress trees, as the Brazos bottoms nourish the wild peach, as
the gentle slopes of East Texas nourish the sweet-smelling pines, as the
barren, rocky ridges along the Pecos nourish the daggered lechuguilla. I
am at home here, and I want not only to know about my home land, I want
to live intelligently on it. I want certain data that will enable me to
accommodate myself to it. Knowledge helps sympathy to achieve harmony.
I am made more resolute by Arthur Hugh Clough's picture of the dripping
sailor on the reeling mast, "On stormy nights when wild northwesters
rave," but the winds that have bit into me have been dry Texas northers;
and fantastic yarns about them, along with a cowboy's story of a herd of
Longhorns drifting to death in front of one of them, come home to me and
illuminate those northers like forked lightning playing along the top of
black clouds in the night.

No informed person would hold that the Southwest can claim any
considerable body of PURE LITERATURE as its own. At the same time, the
region has a distinct cultural inheritance, full of life and drama, told
variously in books so numerous that their very existence would surprise
many people who depend on the Book-of-the-Month Club for literary
guidance. Any people have a right to their own cultural inheritance,
though sheeplike makers of textbooks and sheeplike pedagogues of
American literature have until recently, either wilfully or ignorantly,
denied that right to the Southwest. Tens of thousands of students of the
Southwest have been assigned endless pages on and listened to dronings
over Cotton Mather, Increase Mather, Jonathan Edwards, Anne Bradstreet,
and other dreary creatures of colonial New England who are utterly
foreign to the genius of the Southwest. If nothing in written form
pertaining to the Southwest existed at all, it would be more profitable
for an inhabitant to go out and listen to coyotes singing at night in
the prickly pear than to tolerate the Increase Mather kind of thing. It
is very profitable to listen to coyotes anyhow. I rebelled years ago
at having the tradition, the spirit, the meaning of the soil to which I
belong utterly disregarded by interpreters of literature and at the
same time having the Increase Mather kind of stuff taught as if it were
important to our part of America. Happily the disregard is disappearing,
and so is Increase Mather.
</p>
<p>
If they had to be rigorously classified into hard and fast categories,
comparatively few of the books in the lists that follow would be rated
as pure literature. Fewer would be rated as history. A majority of them
are the stuff of history. The stuff out of which history is made is
generally more vital than formalized history, especially the histories
habitually forced on students in public schools, colleges, and
universities. There is no essential opposition between history and
literature. The attempt to study a people's literature apart from their
social and, to a less extent, their political history is as illogical
as the lady who said she had read Romeo but had not yet got to Juliet.
Nearly any kind of history is more important than formal literary
history showing how in a literary way Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac
begat Jacob. Any man of any time who has ever written with vigor has
been immeasurably nearer to the dunghill on which he sank his talons
while crowing than to all literary ancestors.
</p>
<p>
A great deal of chronicle writing that makes no pretense at being
belles-lettres is really superior literature to much that is so
classified. I will vote three times a day and all night for John C.
Duval's <i>Adventures of Bigfoot Wallace</i>, Charlie Siringo's <i>Riata and
Spurs</i>, James B. Gillett's <i>Six Years with the Texas Rangers</i>, and
dozens of other straightaway chronicles of the Southwest in preference
to "The Culprit Fay" and much other watery "literature" with which
anthologies representing the earlier stages of American writing
are padded. Ike Fridge's pamphlet story of his ridings for John
Chisum&mdash;chief provider of cattle for Billy the Kid to steal&mdash;has more of
the juice of reality in it and, therefore, more of literary virtue than
some of James Fenimore Cooper's novels, and than some of James Russell
Lowell's odes.
</p>
<p>
The one thing essential to writing if it is to be read, to art if it
is to be looked at, is vitality. No critic or professor can be hired
to pump vitality into any kind of human expression, but professors and
critics have taken it out of many a human being who in his attempts
to say something decided to be correct at the expense of being
himself&mdash;being natural, being alive. The priests of literary conformity
never had a chance at the homemade chronicles of the Southwest.
</p>
<p>
The orderly way in which to study the Southwest would be to take up
first the land, its flora, fauna, climate, soils, rivers, etc., then
the aborigines, next the exploring and settling Spaniards, and finally,
after a hasty glance at the French, the English-speaking people who
brought the Southwest to what it is today. We cannot proceed in this
way, however. Neither the prairies nor the Indians who first hunted
deer on them have left any records, other than hieroglyphic, as to their
lives. Some late-coming men have written about them. Droughts and rains
have had far more influence on all forms of life in the Southwest and
on all forms of its development culturally and otherwise than all of the
Coronado expeditions put together. I have emphasized the literature that
reveals nature. My method has been to take up types and subjects rather
than to follow chronology.
</p>
<p>
Chronology is often an impediment to the acquiring of useful knowledge.
I am not nearly so much interested in what happened in Abilene, Kansas,
in 1867&mdash;the year that the first herds of Texas Longhorns over the
Chisholm Trail found a market at that place&mdash;as I am in picking out of
Abilene in 1867 some thing that reveals the character of the men who
went up the trail, some thing that will illuminate certain phenomena
along the trail human beings of the Southwest are going up today, some
thing to awaken observation and to enrich with added meaning this corner
of the earth of which we are the temporary inheritors.
</p>
<p>
By "literature of the Southwest" I mean writings that interpret the
region, whether they have been produced by the Southwest or not. Many of
them have not. What we are interested in is life in the Southwest, and
any interpreter of that life, foreign or domestic, ancient or modern, is
of value.
</p>
<p>
The term Southwest is variable because the boundaries of the Southwest
are themselves fluid, expanding and contracting according to the point
of view from which the Southwest is viewed and according to whatever
common denominator is taken for defining it. The Spanish Southwest
includes California, but California regards itself as more closely akin
to the Pacific Northwest than to Texas; California is Southwest more in
an antiquarian way than other-wise. From the point of view of the most
picturesque and imagination-influencing occupation of the Southwest,
the occupation of ranching, the Southwest might be said to run up into
Montana. Certainly one will have to go up the trail to Montana to finish
out the story of the Texas cowboy. Early in the nineteenth century the
Southwest meant Tennessee, Georgia, and other frontier territory now
regarded as strictly South. The men and women who "redeemed Texas from
the wilderness" came principally from that region. The code of conduct
they gave Texas was largely the code of the booming West. Considering
the character of the Anglo-American people who took over the Southwest,
the region is closer to Missouri than to Kansas, which is not Southwest
in any sense but which has had a strong influence on Oklahoma. Chihuahua
is more southwestern than large parts of Oklahoma. In <i>Our Southwest</i>,
Erna Fergusson has a whole chapter on "What is the Southwest?" She finds
Fort Worth to be in the Southwest but Dallas, thirty miles east, to be
facing north and east. The principal areas of the Southwest are, to have
done with air-minded reservations, Arizona, New Mexico, most of Texas,
some of Oklahoma, and anything else north, south, east, or west that
anybody wants to bring in. The boundaries of cultures and rainfall never
follow survey lines. In talking about the Southwest I naturally incline
to emphasize the Texas part of it.
</p>
<p>
Life is fluid, and definitions that would apprehend it must also be. Yet
I will venture one definition&mdash;not the only one&mdash;of an educated person.
An educated person is one who can view with interest and intelligence
the phenomena of life about him. Like people elsewhere, the people of
the Southwest find the features of the land on which they live blank or
full of pictures according to the amount of interest and intelligence
with which they view the features. Intelligence cannot be acquired, but
interest can; and data for interest and intelligence to act upon are
entirely acquirable.
</p>
<p>
"Studies perfect nature," Bacon said. "Nature follows art" to the extent
that most of us see principally what our attention has been called to.
I might never have noticed rose-purple snow between shadows if I had
not seen a picture of that kind of snow. I had thought white the only
natural color of snow. I cannot think of yew trees, which I have never
seen, without thinking of Wordsworth's poem on three yew trees.
</p>
<p>
Nobody has written a memorable poem on the mesquite. Yet the mesquite
has entered into the social, economic, and aesthetic life of the land;
it has made history and has been painted by artists. In the homely
chronicles of the Southwest its thorns stick, its roots burn into bright
coals, its trunks make fence posts, its lovely leaves wave. To live
beside this beautiful, often pernicious, always interesting and highly
characteristic tree&mdash;or bush&mdash;and to know nothing of its significance is
to be cheated out of a part of life. It is but one of a thousand factors
peculiar to the Southwest and to the land's cultural inheritance.
</p>
<p>
For a long time, as he tells in his <i>Narrative</i>, Cabeza de Vaca was
a kind of prisoner to coastal Indians of Texas. Annually, during the
season when prickly pear apples (<i>tunas</i>, or Indian figs, as they are
called in books) were ripe, these Indians would go upland to feed on
the fruit. During his sojourn with them Cabeza de Vaca went along. He
describes how the Indians would dig a hole in the ground, squeeze the
fruit out of <i>tunas</i> into the hole, and then swill up big drinks of it.
Long ago the Indians vanished, but prickly pears still flourish over
millions of acres of land. The prickly pear is one of the characteristic
growths of the Southwest. Strangers look at it and regard it as odd.
Painters look at it in bloom or in fruit and strive to capture the
colors. During the droughts ranchmen singe the thorns off its leaves,
using a flame-throwing machine, easily portable by a man on foot, fed
from a small gasoline tank. From Central Texas on down into Central
America prickly pear acts as host for the infinitesimal insect called
cochineal, which supplied the famous dyes of Aztec civilization.
</p>
<p>
A long essay might be written on prickly pear. It weaves in and out
of many chronicles of the Southwest. A. J. Sowell, one of the best
chroniclers of Texas pioneer life, tells in his life of Bigfoot Wallace
how that picturesque ranger captain once took one of his wounded men
away from an army surgeon because the surgeon would not apply prickly
pear poultices to the wound. In <i>Rangers and Pioneers of Texas</i>, Sowell
narrates how rattlesnakes were so large and numerous in a great prickly
pear flat out from the Nueces River that rangers pursuing bandits had
to turn back. Nobody has written a better description of a prickly pear
flat than O. Henry in his story of "The Caballero's Way."
</p>
<p>
People may look at prickly pear, and it will be just prickly pear and
nothing more. Or they may look at it and find it full of significances;
the mere sight of a prickly pear may call up a chain of incidents,
facts, associations. A mind that can thus look out on the common
phenomena of life is rich, and all of the years of the person whose mind
is thus stored will be more interesting and full.
</p>
<p>
Cabeza de Vaca's <i>Narrative</i>, the chronicles of A. J. Sowell, and O.
Henry's story are just three samples of southwestern literature that
bring in prickly pear. No active-minded person who reads any one of
these three samples will ever again look at prickly pear in the same
light that he looked at it before he read. Yet prickly pear is just one
of hundreds of manifestations of life in the Southwest that writers have
commented on, told stories about, dignified with significance.
</p>
<p>
Cotton no longer has the economic importance to Texas that it once had.
Still, it is mighty important. In the minds of millions of farm people
of the South, cotton and the boll weevil are associated. The boll weevil
was once a curse; then it came to be somewhat regarded as a disguised
blessing&mdash;in limiting production.
</p>
<pre>
     De first time I seen de boll weevil,
          He was a-settin' on de square.
     Next time I seen him, he had all his family dere&mdash;
          Jest a-lookin' foh a home, jest a-lookin' foh a home.
</pre>
<p>
A man dependent on cotton for a living and having that living threatened
by the boll weevil will not be much interested in ballads, but for the
generality of people this boll weevil ballad&mdash;the entirety of which is
a kind of life history of the insect&mdash;is, while delightful in itself,
a veritable story-book on the weevil. Without the ballad, the weevil's
effect on economic history would be unchanged; but as respects mind and
imagination, the ballad gives the weevil all sorts of significances. The
ballad is a part of the literature of the Southwest.
</p>
<p>
But I am assigning too many motives of self-improvement to reading.
People read for fun, for pleasure. The literature of the Southwest
affords bully reading.
</p>
<p>
"If I had read as much as other men, I would know as little," Thomas
Hobbes is credited with having said. A student in the presence of Bishop
E. D. Mouzon was telling about the scores and scores of books he had
read. At a pause the bishop shook his long, wise head and remarked, "My
son, when DO you get time to think?" Two of the best educated men I have
ever had the fortune of talking with were neither schooled nor widely
read. They were extraordinary observers. One was a plainsman, Charles
Goodnight; the other was a borderer, Don Alberto Guajardo, in part
educated by an old Lipan Indian.
</p>
<p>
But here are the books. I list them not so much to give knowledge as to
direct people with intellectual curiosity and with interest in their own
land to the sources of knowledge; not to create life directly, but to
point out where it has been created or copied. On some of the books I
have made brief observations. Those observations can never be nearly
so important to a reader as the development of his own powers of
observation. With something of an apologetic feeling I confess that I
have read, in my way, most of the books. I should probably have been
a wiser and better informed man had I spent more time out with the
grasshoppers, horned toads, and coyotes. November 5, 1942 J. FRANK DOBIE

<h2>
    2. Interpreters of the Land
</h2>
<p>
"HE'S FOR A JIG or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps." Thought employs
ideas, but having an idea is not the same thing as thinking. A rooster
in a pen of hens has an idea. Thought has never been so popular with
mankind as horse opera, horse play, the main idea behind sheep's eyes.
Far be it from me to feel contempt for people who cannot and do not want
to think. The human species has not yet evolved to the stage at which
thought is natural. I am far more at ease lying in grass and gazing
without thought process at clouds than in sitting in a chair trying to
be logical. Just the same, free play of mind upon life is the essence
of good writing, and intellectual activity is synonymous with critical
interpretations.
</p>
<p>
To the constant disregard of thought, Americans of the mid-twentieth
century have added positive opposition. Critical ideas are apt to
make any critic suspected of being subversive. The Southwest, Texas
especially, is more articulately aware of its land spaces than of any
other feature pertaining to itself. Yet in the realm of government,
the Southwest has not produced a single spacious thinker. So far as the
cultural ancestry of the region goes, the South has been arid of thought
since the time of Thomas Jefferson, the much talked-of mind of John C.
Calhoun being principally casuistic; on another side, derivatives from
the Spanish Inquisition could contribute to thought little more than
tribal medicine men have contributed.
</p>
<p>
Among historians of the Southwest the general rule has been to be
careful with facts and equally careful in avoiding thought-provoking
interpretations. In the multitudinous studies on Spanish-American
history all padres are "good" and all conquistadores are "intrepid," and
that is about as far as interpretation goes. The one state book of
the Southwest that does not chloroform ideas is Erna Fergusson's <i>New
Mexico: A Pageant of Three Peoples</i> (Knopf, New York, 1952). Essayical
in form, it treats only of the consequential. It evaluates from the
point of view of good taste, good sense, and an urbane comprehension of
democracy. The subject is provincial, but the historian transcends all
provincialism. Her sympathy does not stifle conclusions unusable in
church or chamber of commerce propaganda. In brief, a cultivated mind
can take pleasure in this interpretation of New Mexico&mdash;and that marks
it as a solitary among the histories of neighboring states.
</p>
<p>
The outstanding historical interpreter of the Southwest is Walter
Prescott Webb, of the University of Texas. <i>The Great Plains</i> utilizes
chronology to explain the presence of man on the plains; it is primarily
a study in cause and effect, of water and drought, of adaptations and
lack of adaptations, of the land's growth into human imagination as well
as economic institutions. Webb uses facts to get at meanings. He fulfils
Emerson's definition of Scholar: "Man Thinking." In <i>Divided We Stand</i>
he goes into machinery, the feudalism of corporation-dominated economy,
the economic supremacy of the North over the South and the West. In
<i>The Great Frontier</i> (Houghton Mifilin, Boston, 1952) he considers the
Western Hemisphere as a frontier for Europe&mdash;a frontier that brought
about the rise of democracy and capitalism and that, now vanished as a
frontier, foreshadows the vanishment of democracy and capitalism.
</p>
<p>
In <i>Virgin Land: The American West as Symbol and a Myth</i> (Harvard
University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1950) Henry Nash Smith plows
deep. But the tools of this humanistic historian are of delicate finish
rather than of horsepower. To him, thinking is a joyful process and
lucidity out of complexity is natural. He compasses Parrington's <i>Main
Currents in American Thought</i> and Beadle's Dime Novels along with
agriculture and manufacturing. Excepting the powerful books by Walter
Prescott Webb, not since Frederick Jackson Turner, in 1893, presented
his famous thesis on "The Significance of the Frontier in American
History" has such a revealing evaluation of frontier movements appeared
As a matter of fact, Henry Nash Smith leaves Turner's ideas on the
dependence of democracy upon farmers without more than one leg to stand
upon. Not being a King Canute, he does not take sides for or against
social evolution. With the clearest eyes imaginable, he looks into it.
Turner's <i>The Frontier in American History</i> (1920) has been a fertile
begetter of interpretations of history.
</p>
<p>
Instead of being the usual kind of jokesmith book or concatenation
of tall tales, <i>Folk Laughter on the American Frontier</i> by Mody C.
Boatright (Macmillan, New York, 1949) goes into the human and social
significances of humor. Of boastings, anecdotal exaggerations,
hide-and-hair metaphors, stump and pulpit parables, tenderfoot baitings,
and the like there is plenty, but thought plays upon them and arranges
them into patterns of social history.
</p>
<p>
Mary Austin (1868-1934) is an interpreter of nature, which for her
includes naturally placed human beings as much as naturally placed
antelopes and cacti. She wrote <i>The American Rhythm</i> on the theory that
authentic poetry expresses the rhythms of that patch of earth to which
the poet is rooted. Rhythm is experience passed into the subconscious
and is "distinct from our intellectual perception of it." Before they
can make true poetry, English-speaking Americans will be in accord
with "the run of wind in tall grass" as were the Pueblo Indians when
Europeans discovered them. But Mary Austin's primary importance is not
as a theorist. Her spiritual depth is greater than her intellectual. She
is a translator of nature through concrete observations. She interprets
through character sketches, folk tales, novels. "Anybody can write facts
about a country," she said. She infuses fact with understanding and
imagination. In <i>Lost Borders</i>, <i>The Land of Little Rain</i>, <i>The Land of
Journey's Ending</i>, and <i>The Flock</i> the land itself often seems to speak,
but often she gets in its way. She sees "with an eye made quiet by the
power of harmony." <i>Earth Horizons</i>, a stubborn book, is Mary Austin's
inner autobiography. <i>The Beloved House</i>, by T. M. Pearce (Caxton,
Caldwell, Idaho, 1940), is an understanding biography.
</p>
<p>
Joseph Wood Krutch of Columbia University spent a year in Arizona, near
Tucson. Instead of talking about his <i>The Desert Year</i> (Sloane, New
York, 1952), I quote a representative paragraph:
</p>
<p>
In New England the struggle for existence is visibly the struggle of
plant with plant, each battling his neighbor for sunlight and for the
spot of ground which, so far as moisture and nourishment are concerned,
would support them all. Here, the contest is not so much of plant
against plant as of plant against inanimate nature. The limiting factor
is not the neighbor but water; and I wonder if this is, perhaps, one of
the things which makes this country seem to enjoy a kind of peace one
does not find elsewhere. The struggle of living thing against living
thing can be distressing in a way that a mere battle with the elements
is not. If some great clump of cactus dies this summer it will be
because the cactus has grown beyond the capacity of its roots to get
water, not because one green fellow creature has bested it in some
limb-to-limb struggle. In my more familiar East the crowding of the
countryside seems almost to parallel the crowding of the cities. Out
here there is, even in nature, no congestion.
</p>
<p>
<i>Southwest</i>, by Laura Adams Armer (New York, 1935, OP) came from long
living and brooding in desert land. It says something beautiful.
</p>
<p>
<i>Talking to the Moon</i>, by John Joseph Mathews (University of Chicago
Press, 1945) is set in the blackjack country of eastern Oklahoma. This
Oxford scholar of Osage blood built his ranch house around a fireplace,
flanked by shelves of books. His observations are of the outside,
but they are informed by reflections made beside a fire. They are not
bookish at all, but the spirits of great writers mingle with echoes of
coyote wailing and wood-thrush singing.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sky Determines: An Interpretation of the Southwest</i>, by Ross Calvin
(New York, 1934; republished by the University of New Mexico Press)
lives up to its striking title. The introductory words suggest the
essence of the book:
</p>
<p>
In New Mexico whatever is both old and peculiar appears upon examination
to have a connection with the arid climate. Peculiarities range from the
striking adaptations of the flora onward to those of fauna, and on up
to those of the human animal. Sky determines. And the writer once
having picked up the trail followed it with certainty, and indeed almost
inevitably, as it led from ecology to anthropology and economics.
</p>
<p>
Cultivated intellect is the highest form of civilization. It is
inseparable from the arts, literature, architecture. In any civilized
land, birds, trees, flowers, animals, places, human contributors to
life out of the past, all are richer and more significant because of
representations through literature and art. No literate person can
listen to a skylark over an English meadow without hearing in its
notes the melodies of Chaucer and Shelley. As the Southwest advances
in maturity of mind and civilization, the features of the land take on
accretions from varied interpreters.
</p>
<p>
It is not necessary for an interpreter to write a whole book about
a feature to bring out its significance. We need more gossipy
books&mdash;something in the manner of <i>Pinon Country</i> by Haniel Long (Duell,
Sloan and Pearce, New York, 1941), in which one can get a swift slant on
Billy the Kid, smell the pinon trees, feel the deeply religious attitude
toward his corn patch of a Zuni Indian. Roy Bedichek's chapters on the
mockingbird, in <i>Adventures with a Texas Naturalist</i>, are like rich talk
under a tree on a pleasant patch of ground staked out for his claim by
an April-voiced mockingbird. In <i>The Voice of the Coyote</i> I tried
to compass the whole animal, and I should think that the "Father
of Song-Making" chapter might make coyote music and the night more
interesting and beautiful for any listener. Intelligent writers often
interpret without set purpose, and many books under various categories
in this <i>Guide</i> are interpretative.

    3. General Helps
</h2>
<p>
THERE IS no chart to the Life and Literature of the Southwest. An
attempt to put it all into an alphabetically arranged encyclopedia would
be futile. All guides to knowledge are too long or too short. This one
at the outset adds to its length&mdash;perhaps to its usefulness&mdash;by citing
other general reference works and a few anthologies.
</p>
<p>
<i>Books of the Southwest: A General Bibliography</i>, by Mary Tucker,
published by J. J. Augustin, New York, 1937, is better on Indians and
the Spanish period than on Anglo-American culture. <i>Southwest Heritage:
A Literary History with Bibliography</i>, by Mabel Major, Rebecca W. Smith,
and T. M. Pearce, University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, 1938,
revised 1948, takes up the written material under the time-established
heads of Fiction, Poetry, Drama, etc., with due respect to chronological
development. <i>A Treasury of Southern Folklore</i>, 1949, and <i>A Treasury of
Western Folklore</i>, 1951, both edited by B. A. Botkin and both published
by Crown, New York, are so liberal in the extensions of folklore and so
voluminous that they amount to literary anthologies.
</p>
<p>
Of possible use in working out certain phases of life and literature
common to the Southwest as well as to the West and Middle West are the
following academic treatises: <i>The Frontier in American Literature</i>,
by Lucy Lockwood Hazard, New York, 1927; <i>The Literature of the Middle
Western Frontier</i>, by Ralph Leslie Rusk, New York, 1925; <i>The Prairie
and the Making of Middle America</i>, by Dorothy Anne Dondore, Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, 1926; <i>The Literature of the Rocky Mountain West
1803-1903</i>, by L. J. Davidson and P. Bostwick, Caldwell, Idaho, 1939;
and <i>The Rediscovery of the Frontier</i>, by Percy H. Boynton, Chicago,
1931. Anyone interested in vitality in any phase of American writing
will find Vernon L. Parrington's <i>Main Currents in American Thought</i>
(three vols.), New York, 1927-39, an opener-up of avenues.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the best anthology of southwestern narratives is <i>Golden Tales
of the Southwest</i>, selected by Mary L. Becker, New York, 1939. Two
anthologies of southwestern writings are <i>Southwesterners Write</i>, edited
by T. M. Pearce and A. P. Thomason, University of New Mexico Press,
Albuquerque, 1946, and <i>Roundup Time</i>, edited by George Sessions Perry,
Whittlesey House, New York, 1943. Themes common to the Southwest are
represented in <i>Western Prose and Poetry</i>, an anthology put together by
Rufus A. Coleman, New York, 1932, and in <i>Mid Country: Writings from the
Heart of America</i>, edited by Lowry C. Wimberly, University of Nebraska
Press, Lincoln, 1945.
</p>
<p>
For the southern tradition that has flowed into the Southwest Franklin
J. Meine's <i>Tall Tales of the Southwest</i>, New York, 1930, OP, is the
best anthology published. It is the best anthology of any kind that I
know of. <i>A Southern Treasury of Life and Literature</i>, selected by Stark
Young, New York, 1937, brings in Texas.
</p>
<p>
Anthologies of poetry are listed under the heading of "Poetry and
Drama." The outstanding state bibliography of the region is <i>A
Bibliography of Texas</i>, by C. W. Raines, Austin, 1896. Since this is
half a century behind the times, its usefulness is limited. At that,
it is more useful than the shiftless, hit-and-miss, ignorance-revealing
<i>South of Forty: From the Mississippi to the Rio Grande: A
Bibliography</i>, by Jesse L. Rader, Norman, Oklahoma, 1947. Henry
R. Wagner's <i>The Plains and the Rockies</i>, "a contribution to the
bibliography of original narratives of travel and adventure, 1800-1865,"
which came out 1920-21, was revised and extended by Charles L. Camp and
reprinted in 1937. It is stronger on overland travel than on anything
else, only in part covers the Southwest, and excludes a greater length
of time than Raines's <i>Bibliography</i>. Now published by Long's College

Mary G. Boyer's <i>Arizona in Literature</i>, Glendale, California, 1934, is
an anthology that runs toward six hundred pages. <i>Texas Prose Writings</i>,
by Sister M. Agatha, Dallas, 1936, OP, is a meaty, critical survey. L.
W. Payne's handbook-sized <i>A Survey of Texas Literature</i>, Chicago, 1928,

<i>A Guide to Materials Bearing on Cultural Relations in New Mexico</i>,
University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, 1944, is so logical and
liberal-minded that in some respects it amounts to a bibliography of the
whole Southwest; it recognizes the overriding of political boundaries
by ideas, human types, and other forms of culture. The <i>New Mexico
Quarterly</i>, published by the University of New Mexico, furnishes
periodically a bibliographical record of contemporary literature of the
Southwest. <i>New Mexico's Own Chronicle</i>, edited by Maurice G. Fulton and
Paul Horgan (Dallas, 1937, OP), is an anthology strong on the historical
side.

    4. Indian Culture; Pueblos and Navajos
</h2>
<p>
THE LITERATURE on the subject of Indians is so extensive and ubiquitous
that, unless a student of Americana is pursuing it, he may find it more
troublesome to avoid than to get hold of. The average old-timer has
for generations regarded Indian scares and fights as the most important
theme for reminiscences. County-minded historians have taken the same
point of view. The Bureau of American Ethnology of the Smithsonian
Institution has buried records of Indian beliefs, ceremonies, mythology,
and other folklore in hundreds of tomes; laborious, literal-minded
scholars of other institutions have been as assiduous. In all this lore
and tabulation of facts, the Indian folk themselves have generally been
dried out.
</p>
<p>
The Anglo-American's policy toward the Indian was to kill him and take
his land, perhaps make a razor-strop out of his hide. The Spaniard's
policy was to baptize him, take his land, enslave him, and appropriate
his women. Any English-speaking frontiersman who took up with the
Indians was dubbed "squaw man"&mdash;a term of sinister connotations. Despite
pride in descending from Pocahontas and in the vaunted Indian blood of
such individuals as Will Rogers, crossbreeding between Anglo-Americans
and Indians has been restricted, as compared, for instance, with the
interdicted crosses between white men and black women. The Spaniards,
on the other hand, crossed in battalions with the Indians, generating
<i>mestizo</i> (mixed-blooded) nations, of which Mexico is the chief example.
</p>
<p>
As a result, the English-speaking occupiers of the land have in general
absorbed directly only a minimum of Indian culture&mdash;nothing at all
comparable to the Uncle Remus stories and characters and the spiritual
songs and the blues music from the Negroes. Grandpa still tells how his
own grandpa saved or lost his scalp during a Comanche horse-stealing
raid in the light of the moon; Boy Scouts hunt for Indian arrowheads;
every section of the country has a bluff called Lovers' Leap, where,
according to legend, a pair of forlorn Indian lovers, or perhaps only
one of the pair, dived to death; the maps all show Caddo Lake, Kiowa
Peak, Squaw Creek, Tehuacana Hills, Nacogdoches town, Cherokee County,
Indian Gap, and many another place name derived from Indian days. All
such contacts with Indian life are exterior. Three forms of Indian
culture are, however, weaving into the life patterns of America.
</p>
<p>
(1) The Mexicans have naturally inherited and assimilated Indian lore
about plants, animals, places, all kinds of human relationships with
the land. Through the Mexican medium, with which he is becoming more
sympathetic, the gringo is getting the ages-old Indian culture.
</p>
<p>
(2) The Pueblo and Navajo Indians in particular are impressing their
arts, crafts, and ways of life upon special groups of Americans living
near them, and these special groups are transmitting some of their
acquisitions. The special groups incline to be arty and worshipful, but
they express a salutary revolt against machined existence and they have
done much to revive dignity in Indian life. Offsetting dilettantism, the
Museum of New Mexico and associated institutions and artists and other
individuals have fostered Indian pottery, weaving, silversmithing,
dancing, painting, and other arts and crafts. Superior craftsmanship can
now depend upon a fairly reliable market; the taste of American buyers
has been somewhat elevated.
</p>
<pre>
          O mountains, pure and holy, give me
     a song, a strong and holy song to bless
     my flock and bring the rain!
</pre>
<p>
This is from "Navajo Holy Song," as rendered by Edith Hart Mason. It
expresses a spiritual content in Indian life far removed from the We and
God, Incorporated form of religion ordained by the National Association
of Manufacturers.
</p>
<p>
(3) The wild freedom, mobility, and fierce love of liberty of
the mounted Indians of the Plains will perhaps always stir
imaginations&mdash;something like the charging Cossacks, the camping Arabs,
and the migrating Tartars. There is no romance in Indian fights east
of the Mississippi. The mounted Plains Indians always made a big hit in
Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. Little boys still climb into their seats
and cry out when red horsemen of the Plains ride across the screen.

    5. Apaches, Comanches, and Other Plains Indians
</h2>
<p>
THE APACHES and the bareback Indians of the Plains were extraordinary
<i>hombres del campo&mdash;</i>men of the outdoors, plainsmen, woodsmen, trailers,
hunters, endurers. They knew some phases of nature with an intimacy that
few civilized naturalists ever attain to. It is unfortunate that most
of the literature about them is from their enemies. Yet an enemy often
teaches a man more than his friends and makes him work harder.

was a magnificent specimen of manhood with swart Indian complexion.
He fought in the Canadian army during World War I and thus became
acquainted with the Blackfeet. No matter what the facts of his life, he
wrote a vivid and moving autobiography of a Blackfoot Indian in whom the
spirit of the tribe and the natural life of the Plains during buffalo
days were incorporated. In 1932 in the California home of Anita Baldwin,

    6. Spanish-Mexican Strains
</h2>
<p>
THE MEXICAN Revolution that began in 1910 resulted in a rich development
of the native cultural elements of Mexico, the art of Diego Rivera being
one of the highlights of this development. The native culture is closer
to the Mexican earth and to the indigenes than to Spain, notwithstanding
modern insistence on the Latin in Latin-American culture.
</p>
<p>
The Spaniards, through Mexico, have had an abiding influence on the
architecture and language of the Southwest. They gave us our most
distinctive occupation, ranching on the open range. They influenced
mining greatly, and our land titles and irrigation laws still go back
to Spanish and Mexican sources. After more than a hundred years of
occupation of Texas and almost that length of time in other parts of
the Southwest, the English-speaking Americans still have the rich
accumulations of lore pertaining to coyotes, mesquites, prickly pear,
and many other plants and animals to learn from the Mexicans, who got
their lore partly from intimate living with nature but largely through
Indian ancestry.

scholars, Dr. Bolton has surpassed all other American historians of his
time in output on Spanish-American history. <i>Coronado</i> is the climax

    8. Backwoods Life and Humor
</h2>
<p>
THE SETTLERS who put their stamp on Texas were predominantly from the
southern states&mdash;and far more of them came to Texas to work out of debt
than came with riches in the form of slaves. The plantation owner came
too, but the go-ahead Crockett kind of backwoodsman was typical. The
southern type never became so prominent in New Mexico, Arizona, and
California as in Texas. Nevertheless, the fact glares out that the code
of conduct&mdash;the riding and shooting tradition, the eagerness to stand up
and fight for one's rights, the readiness to back one's judgment with
a gun, a bowie knife, money, life itself&mdash;that characterized the whole
West as well as the Southwest was southern, hardly at all New England.
</p>
<p>
The very qualities that made many of the Texas pioneers rebels to
society and forced not a few of them to quit it between sun and
sun without leaving new addresses fitted them to conquer the
wilderness&mdash;qualities of daring, bravery, reckless abandon, heavy
self-assertiveness. A lot of them were hell-raisers, for they had a lust
for life and were maddened by tame respectability. Nobody but obsequious
politicians and priggish "Daughters" wants to make them out as models
of virtue and conformity. A smooth and settled society&mdash;a society
shockingly tame&mdash;may accept Cardinal Newman's definition, "A gentleman
is one who never gives offense." Under this definition a shaded violet,
a butterfly, and a floating summer cloud are all gentlemen. "The art of
war," said Napoleon, "is to make offense." Conquering the hostile Texas
wilderness meant war with nature and against savages as well as against
Mexicans. Go-ahead Crockett's ideal of a gentleman was one who looked
in another direction while a visitor was pouring himself out a horn of
whiskey.
</p>
<p>
Laying aside climatic influences on occupations and manners, certain
Spanish influences, and minor Pueblo Indian touches, the Southwest from
the point of view of the bedrock Anglo-Saxon character that has made it
might well include Arkansas and Missouri. The realism of southern folk
and of a very considerable body of indigenous literature representing
them has been too much overshadowed by a kind of <i>So Red the Rose</i>
idealization of slave-holding aristocrats.

    10. Fighting Texians
</h2>
<p>
THE TEXAS PEOPLE belong to a fighting tradition that the majority of
them are proud of. The footholds that the Spaniards and Mexicans held in
Texas were maintained by virtue of fighting, irrespective of missionary
baptizing. The purpose of the Anglo-American colonizer Stephen F. Austin
to "redeem Texas from the wilderness" was accomplished only by fighting.
The Texans bought their liberty with blood and maintained it for nine
years as a republic with blood. It was fighting men who pushed back the
frontiers and blazed trails.
</p>
<p>
The fighting tradition is now giving way to the oil tradition. The Texas
myth as imagined by non-Texans is coming to embody oil millionaires in
airplanes instead of horsemen with six-shooters and rifles. See Edna
Ferber's Giant (1952 novel). Nevertheless, many Texans who never rode
a horse over three miles at a stretch wear cowboy boots, and a lot of
Texans are under the delusion that bullets and atomic bombs can settle
complexities that demand informed intelligence and the power to think.
</p>
<p>
As I have pointed out in <i>The Flavor of Texas</i>, the chronicles of men
who fought the Mexicans and were prisoners to them comprise a unique
unit in the personal narratives and annals of America.
</p>
<p>
Many of the books listed under the headings of "Texas Rangers," "How the
Early Settlers Lived," and "Range Life" specify the fighting tradition.

Letters</i>, by J. Frank Dobie (illustrated by Tom Lea), Dallas, 1939.
OP. <i>Early Times in Texas</i>, called "the <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> of Texas," is
Duval's story of the Goliad Massacre and of his escape from it. Duval
served as a Texas Ranger with Bigfoot Wallace, who was in the Mier
Expedition. His narrative of Bigfoot's <i>Adventures</i> is the rollickiest
and the most flavorsome that any American frontiersman has yet inspired.

the Republic of Texas to annex New Mexico. Lost on the Staked Plains and
then marched afoot as a prisoner to Mexico City, he found plenty of copy
and wrote a narrative that if it were not so journalistically verbose
might rank alongside Dana's <i>Two Years Before the Mast</i>. Fayette
Copeland's <i>Kendall of the Picayune</i>, 1943 but OP, is a biography. An

LEACH, JOSEPH. <i>The Typical Texan: Biography of an American Myth</i>,
Southern Methodist University Press, Dallas, 1952. At the time Texas
was emerging, the three main types of Americans were Yankees, southern
aristocrats, Kentucky westerners embodied by Daniel Boone. Texas took
over the Kentucky tradition. It was enlarged by Crockett, who stayed in
Texas only long enough to get killed, Sam Houston, and Bigfoot Wallace.
Novels, plays, stories, travel books, and the Texans themselves have
kept the tradition going. This is the main thesis of the book. Mr. Leach
fails to note that the best books concerning Texas have done little to
keep the typical Texan alive and that a great part of the present Texas
Brags spirit is as absurdly unrealistic as Mussolini's splurge at making
twentieth-century Italians imagine themselves a {illust. caption = John
W. Thomason, in his <i>Lone Star Preacher</i> (1941)} reincarnation of

    11. Texas Rangers
</h2>
<p>
THE TEXAS RANGERS were never more than a handful in number, but they
were picked men who knew how to ride, shoot, and tell the truth. On the
Mexican border and on the Indian frontier, a few rangers time and again
proved themselves more effective than battalions of soldiers.
</p>
<pre>
     Oh, pray for the ranger, you kind-hearted stranger,
          He has roamed over the prairies for many a year;
     He has kept the Comanches from off your ranches,
          And chased them far over the Texas frontier.

    12. Women Pioneers
</h2>
<p>
ONE REASON for the ebullience of life and rollicky carelessness on the
frontiers of the West was the lack&mdash;temporary&mdash;of women. The men, mostly
young, had given no hostages to fortune. They were generally as free
from family cares as the buccaneers. This was especially true of the
first ranches on the Great Plains, of cattle trails, of mining camps,
logging camps, and of trapping expeditions. It was not true of the
colonial days in Texas, of ranch life in the southern part of Texas,
of homesteading all over the West, of emigrant trails to California and
Oregon, of backwoods life.

    13. Circuit Riders and Missionaries
</h2>
<p>
NOTWITHSTANDING both the tradition and the facts of hardshooting,
hard-riding cowboys, of bad men, of border lawlessness, of inhabitants
who had left some other place under a cloud, of frontier towns
"west of God," hard layouts and conscienceless "courthouse
crowds"&mdash;notwithstanding all this, the Southwest has been and is
religious-minded. This is not to say that it is spiritual-natured.
It belongs to H. L. Mencken's "Bible Belt." "Pass-the-Biscuits"
Pappy O'Daniel got to be governor of Texas and then U.S. senator by
advertising his piety. A politician as "ignorant as a Mexican hog" on
foreign affairs and the complexities of political economy can run in
favor of what he and the voters call religion and leave an informed man
of intellect and sincerity in the shade. The biggest campmeeting in the
Southwest, the Bloys Campmeeting near Fort Davis, Texas, is in the midst
of an enormous range country away from all factories and farmers.
</p>
<p>
Since about 1933 the United States Indian Service has not only allowed
but rather encouraged the Indians to revert to their own religious
ceremonies. They have always been religious. The Spanish colonists
of the Southwest, as elsewhere, were zealously Catholic, and their
descendants have generally remained Catholic. The first English-speaking
settlers of the region&mdash;the colonists led by Stephen F. Austin to
Texas&mdash;were overwhelmingly Protestant, though in order to establish
Mexican citizenship and get titles to homestead land they had,
technically, to declare themselves Catholics. One of the causes of the
Texas Revolution as set forth by the Texans in their Declaration of
Independence was the Mexican government's denial of "the right
of worshipping the Almighty according to the dictates of our own
conscience." A history of southwestern society that left out the
Bible would be as badly gapped as one leaving out the horse or the
six-shooter.
</p>
<p>
See chapter entitled "On the Lord's Side" in Dobie's <i>The Flavor of
Texas</i>. Most of the books listed under "How the Early Settlers Lived"
contain information on religion and preachers. Church histories are
about as numerous as state histories. Virtually all county histories
take into account church development. The books listed below are strong

learning." He seems to me more unlovely in his intolerance and

<h2>
    14. Lawyers, Politicians, J. P.'s
</h2>
<p>
STEPHEN F. AUSTIN wanted to exclude lawyers, along with roving
frontiersmen, from his colonies in Texas, and hoped thus to promote a
utopian society. The lawyers got in, however. Their wit, the anecdotes
of which they were both subject and author, and the political stories
they made traditional from the stump, have not been adequately set down.
As criminal lawyers they stood as high in society as corporation lawyers
stand now and were a good deal more popular, though less wealthy. The
code of independence that fostered personal violence and justified
killings&mdash;in contradistinction to murders&mdash;and that ran to excess
in outlaws naturally fostered the criminal lawyer. His type is now
virtually obsolete.
</p>
<p>
Keen observers, richly stored in experience and delightful in talk, as
many lawyers of the Southwest have been and are, very few of them have
written on other than legal subjects. James D. Lynch's <i>The Bench
and the Bar of Texas</i> (1885) is confined to the eminence of "eminent
jurists" and to the mastery of "masters of jurisprudence." What we
want is the flavor of life as represented by such characters as witty
Three-Legged Willie (Judge R. M. Williamson) and mysterious Jonas
Harrison. It takes a self-lover to write good autobiography. Lawyers are
certainly as good at self-loving as preachers, but we have far better
autobiographic records of circuit riders than of early-day lawyers.
</p>
<p>
Like them, the pioneer justice of peace resides more in folk anecdotes
than in chroniclings. Horace Bell's expansive <i>On the Old West Coast</i>
so represents him. A continent away, David Crockett, in his
<i>Autobiography</i>, confessed, "I was afraid some one would ask me what the
judiciary was. If I knowed I wish I may be shot." Before this, however,
Crockett had been a J. P. "I gave my decisions on the principles of
common justice and honesty between man and man, and relied on natural
born sense, and not on law learning to guide me; for I had never read a
page in a law book in all my life."

    15. Pioneer Doctors
</h2>
<p>
BEFORE the family doctors came, frontiersmen sawed off legs with
handsaws, tied up arteries with horsetail hair, cauterized them with
branding irons. Before homemade surgery with steel tools was practiced,
Mexican <i>curanderas</i> (herb women) supplied <i>remedios</i>, and they still
know the medicinal properties of every weed and bush. Herb stores in
San Antonio, Brownsville, and El Paso do a thriving business. Behind the
<i>curanderas</i> were the medicine men of the tribes. Not all their lore
was superstition, as any one who reads the delectable autobiography
of Gideon Lincecum, published by the Mississippi Historical Society
in 1904, will agree. Lincecum, learned in botany, a sharply-edged
individual who later moved to Texas, went out to live with a Choctaw
medicine man and wrote down all his lore about the virtues of native
plants. The treatise has never been printed.
</p>
<p>
The extraordinary life of Lincecum has, however, been interestingly
delineated in Samuel Wood Geiser's <i>Naturalists of the Frontier</i>,
Southern Methodist University Press, 1937, 1948, and in Pat Ireland
Nixon's <i>The Medical Story of Early Texas</i>, listed below. No historical

Montgomery, the subject of I. K. Stephens' biography listed below.

Plantation, near Hempstead, once known as Sixshooter Junction. Here, in
utter isolation from people of cultivated minds, he conducted scientific
experiments in his inadequate laboratory and thought out a philosophy
said to be half a century ahead of his time. He died in 1911. His life
was the drama of an elevated soul of complexities, far more tragic than
any life associated with the lurid "killings" around him.

    16. Mountain Men
</h2>
<p>
AS USED HERE, the term "Mountain Men" applies to those trappers and
traders who went into the Rocky Mountains before emigrants had even
sought a pass through them to the west or cattle had beat out a trail
on the plains east of them. Beaver fur was the lodestar for the Mountain
Men. Their span of activity was brief, their number insignificant.
Yet hardly any other distinct class of men, irrespective of number or
permanence, has called forth so many excellent books as the Mountain
Men. The books are not nearly so numerous as those connected with range
life, but when one considers the writings of Stanley Vestal, Sabin,
Ruxton, Fer gusson, Chittenden, Favour, Garrard, Inman, Irving, Reid,
and White in this Seld, one doubts whether any other form of American
life at all has been so well covered in ballad, fiction, biography,
history.

    17. Santa Fe and the Santa Fe Trail
</h2>
<p>
THERE WAS Independence on the Missouri River, then eight hundred miles
of twisting trail across hills, plains, and mountains, all uninhabited
save by a few wandering Indians and uncountable buffaloes. Then there
was Santa Fe. On west of it lay nearly a thousand miles of wild broken
lands before one came to the village of Los Angeles. But there was
no trail to Los Angeles. At Santa Fe the trail turned south and after
crawling over the Jornada del Muerto&mdash;Journey of the Dead Man&mdash;threading
the great Pass of the North (El Paso) and crossing a vast desert,
reached Chihuahua City.
</p>
<p>
Looked at in one way, Santa Fe was a mud village. In another way, it was
the solitary oasis of human picturesqueness in a continent of vacancy.
Like that of Athens, though of an entirely different quality, its fame
was out of all proportion to its size. In a strong chapter, entitled "A
Caravan Enters Santa Fe," R. L. Duffus <i>(The Santa Fe Trail)</i> elaborates
on how for all travelers the town always had "the lure of adventure."
Josiah Gregg doubted whether "the first sight of the walls of Jerusalem
were beheld with much more tumultuous and soul-enrapturing joy" than
Santa Fe was by a caravan topping the last rise and, eight hundred miles
of solitude behind it, looking down on the town's shining walls and
cottonwoods.
</p>
<p>
No other town of its size in America has been the subject of and focus
for as much good literature as Santa Fe. Pittsburgh and dozens of
other big cities all put together have not inspired one tenth of
the imaginative play that Santa Fe has inspired. Some of the
transcontinental railroads probably carry as much freight in a day as
went over the Santa Fe Trail in all the wagons in all the years they
pulled over the Santa Fe Trail. But the Santa Fe Trail is one of the
three great trails of America that, though plowed under, fenced across,
and cemented over, seem destined for perennial travel&mdash;by those happily
able to go without tourist guides. To quote Robert Louis Stevenson, "The
greatest adventures are not those we go to seek." The other two trails
comparable to the Santa Fe are also of the West&mdash;the Oregon Trail for
emigrants and the Chisholm Trail for cattle.

    18. Stagecoaches, Freighting
</h2>
<p>
A GOOD INTRODUCTION to a treatment of the stagecoach of the West would
be Thomas De Quincey's "The English Mail-Coach." The proper place to
read about the coaches would be in Doctor Lyon's Pony Express Museum,
out from Pasadena, California. May it never perish! Old Monte drives up
now and then in Alfred Henry Lewis' <i>Wolfville</i> tales, and Bret Harte
made Yuba Bill crack the Whip; but, somehow, considering all the
excellent expositions and reminiscing of stage-coaching in western
America, the proud, insolent, glorious figure of the driver has not been
adequately pictured.

    19. Pony Express

<h3>
    "PRESENTLY the driver exclaims, `Here he comes!'
</h3>
<p>
"Every neck is stretched and every eye strained. Away across the endless
dead level of the prairie a black speck appears against the sky. In a
second or two it becomes a horse and rider, rising and falling, rising
and falling sweeping towards us nearer and nearer&mdash;growing more and more
distinct, more and more sharply defined&mdash;nearer and still nearer, and
the flutter of the hoofs comes faintly to the ear&mdash;another instant a
whoop and a hurrah from our upper deck [of the stagecoach], a wave of
the rider's hand, but no reply, and man and horse burst past our excited
faces, and go swinging away like a belated fragment of a storm."&mdash;Mark
Twain, <i>Roughing It</i>.
</p>
<p>
A word cannot be defined in its own terms; nor can a region, or a
feature of that region. Analogy and perspective are necessary for
comprehension. The sense of horseback motion has never been better
realized than by Kipling in "The Ballad of East and West." See "Horses."

    20. Surge of Life in the West
</h2>
<p>
THE WANDERINGS of Cabeza de Vaca, Coronado, De Soto, and La Salle had
long been chronicled, although the chronicles had not been popularized
in English, when in 1804 Captain Meriwether Lewis and Captain William
Clark set out to explore not only the Louisiana Territory, which had
just been purchased for the United States by President Thomas Jefferson,
but on west to the Pacific. Their <i>Journals</i>, published in 1814,
initiated a series of chronicles comparable in scope, vitality, and
manhood adventure to the great collection known as <i>Hakluyt's Voyages</i>.
</p>
<p>
Between 1904 and 1907 Reuben Gold Thwaites, one of the outstanding
editors of the English-speaking world, brought out in thirty-two volumes
his epic <i>Early Western Travels</i>. This work includes the Lewis and Clark
<i>Journals</i>, every student of the West, whether Northwest or Southwest,
goes to the collection sooner or later. It is a commentary on the
values of life held by big rich boasters of patriotism in the West that
virtually all the chronicles in the collection remain out of print.
</p>
<p>
An important addendum to the Thwaites collection of <i>Early Western
Travels</i> is "The Southwest Historical Series," edited by Ralph
P. Bieber&mdash;twelve volumes, published 1931-43, by Clark, Glendale,
California.
</p>
<p>
The stampede to California that began in 1849 climaxed all migration
orgies of the world in its lust for gold; but the lust for gold was
merely one manifestation of a mighty population's lust for life.
Railroads raced each other to cross the continent. Ten million Longhorns
were going up the trails; from Texas while the last of a hundred million
buffaloes, killed in herds&mdash;the greatest slaughter in history&mdash;were
being skinned. Dodge City was the Cowboy Capital of the world, and
Chicago was becoming "hog butcher of the world." Miller and Lux were
expanding their ranges so that, as others boasted, their herds could
trail from Oregon to Baja California and bed down every night on Miller
and Lux's own grass.
</p>
<p>
Hubert Howe Bancroft (1832-1918) was massing in San Francisco at his
own expense the greatest assemblage of historical documents any one
individual ever assembled. While his interviewers and note-takers sorted
down tons of manuscript, he was employing a corps of historians to write
what, at first designed as a history of the Pacific states, grew in
twenty-eight volumes to embrace also Alaska, British Columbia, Texas,
Mexico, and Central America, aside from five volumes on the Native Races
and six volumes of essays. Meantime he was printing these volumes
in sets of thousands and selling them through an army of agents that
covered America.
</p>
<p>
Collis P. Huntington (1821-1900) was building the Southern Pacific
Railroad into a network, interlocked with other systems and steamship
lines, not only enveloping California land but also the whole economic
and political life of that and other states, with headquarters in the
U.S. Congress. Then his nephew, Henry E. Huntington (1850-1927),
taking over his wealth and power, was building gardens at San Marino,
California, collecting art, books, and manuscripts to make, without
benefit of any institution of learning and in defiance of all the slow
processes of tradition found at Oxford and Harvard, a Huntington
Library and a Huntington Art Gallery that, set down amid the most costly
botanical profusion imaginable, now rival the world's finest.
</p>
<p>
The dreams were of empire. Old men and young toiled as "terribly" as
mighty Raleigh. The "spacious times" of Queen Elizabeth seemed, indeed,
to be translated to another sphere, though here the elements that went
into the mixture were less diverse. Boom methods of Gargantuan scale
were applied to cultural factors as well as to the physical. Few men
stopped to reflect that while objects of art may be bought by the
wholesale, the development of genuine culture is too intimately personal
and too chemically blended with the spiritual to be bartered for. The
Huntingtons paid a quarter of a million dollars for Gainsborough's "The
Blue Boy." It is very beautiful. Meanwhile the mustang grapevine waits
for some artist to paint the strong and lovely grace of its drapery and
thereby to enrich for land-dwellers every valley where it hangs over elm
or oak.
</p>
<p>
Most of the books in this section could be placed in other sections.
Many have been. They represent the vigor, vitality, energy, and daring
characteristic of our frontiers. To quote Harvey Fergusson's phrase, the
adventures of mettle have always had "a tension that would not let them
rest."

BELL, HORACE. <i>Reminiscences of a Ranger, or Early Times in California</i>,

BIDWELL, JOHN (1819-1900). <i>Echoes of the Past</i>, Chico, California
(about 1900). Bidwell got to California several years before gold was
discovered. He became foremost citizen and entertained scientists,
writers, scholars, and artists at his ranch home. His brief accounts
of the trip across the plains and of pioneer society in California are
graphic, charming, telling. The book goes in and out of print but is not
likely to die.

BILLINGTON, RAY ALLEN. <i>Westward Expansion: A History of the American
Frontier</i>, Macmillan, New York, 1949. This Alpha to Omega treatise
concludes with a seventy-five-page, double-column, fine-print
bibliography which not only lists but comments upon most books and
articles of any consequence that have been published on frontier
history.

BOURKE, JOHN G. <i>On the Border with Crook</i>, New York, 1891. Now
published by Long's College Book Co., Columbus, Ohio. Bourke had an
eager, disciplined mind, at once scientific and humanistic; he had
imagination and loyalty to truth and justice; he had a strong body
and joyed in frontier exploring. He was a captain in the army but had
nothing of the littleness of the army mind exhibited by Generals Nelson
Miles and O. O. Howard in their egocentric reminiscences. I rank his
book as the meatiest and richest of all books dealing with campaigns
against Indians. In its amplitude it includes the whole frontier.
General George Crook was a wise, generous, and noble man, but his
<i>Autobiography</i> (edited by Martin F. Schmitt; University of Oklahoma
Press) lacks that power in writing necessary to turn the best subject
on earth into a good book and capable also, as Darwin demonstrated, of
turning earthworms into a classic.

BURNHAM, FREDERICK RUSSELL. <i>Scouting on Two Continents</i>, New York,
1926; reprinted, Los Angeles, 1942. A brave book of enthralling

DEVOTO, BERNARD. <i>The Year of Decision 1846</i>, Houghton Mifflin, Boston,
1943. Critical interpretation as well as depiction. The Mexican War,

EMORY, LIEUTENANT COLONEL WILLIAM H. <i>Notes of a Military Reconnaissance
from Fort Leavenworth, in Missouri, to San Diego, in California,
including Part of the Arkansas, Del Norte, and Gila Rivers</i>, Washington,
1848. Emory's own vivid report is only one item in <i>Executive Document
No. 41</i>, 30th Congress, 1st Session, with which it is bound. Lieutenant
J. W. Albert's <i>Journal</i> and additional <i>Report on New Mexico</i>, St.
George Cooke's Odyssey of his march from Santa Fe to San Diego, another
<i>Journal</i> by Captain A. R. Johnson, the Torrey-Englemann report on
botany, illustrated with engravings, all go to make this one of the
meatiest of a number of meaty government publications. The Emory part of
it has been reprinted by the University of New Mexico Press, under title
of <i>Lieutenant Emory Reports</i>, Introduction and Notes by Ross Calvin,
Albuquerque, 1951.
</p>
<p>
Emory's great two-volume <i>Report on United States and Mexican Boundary
Survey</i>, Washington 1857 and 1859, is, aside from descriptions of
borderlands and their inhabitants, a veritable encyclopedia, wonderfully
illustrated, on western flora and fauna. United States Commissioner
on this Boundary Survey (following the Mexican War) was John Russell
Bartlett. While exploring from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific and
far down into Mexico, he wrote <i>Personal Narrative of Explorations
and Incidents in Texas, New Mexico, California, Sonora and Chihuahua</i>.
published in two volumes, New York, 1854. For me very little rewritten
history has the freshness and fascination of these strong, firsthand
personal narratives, though I recognize many of them as being the stuff
of literature rather than literature itself.

FOWLER, JACOB. <i>The Journal of Jacob Fowler, 1821-1822</i>, edited by
Elliott Coues, New York, 1898. Hardly another chronicle of the West is

GAMBRELL, HERBERT. <i>Anson Jones: The Last President of Texas</i>, Garden
City, New York, 1948; now distributed by Southern Methodist University

Infused with a larger comprehension than that behind many a world
figure, this biography of a provincial figure is perhaps the most
artfully written that Texas has produced. It goes into the soul of the
man.

HULBERT, ARCHER BUTLER. <i>Forty-Niners: The Chronicle of the California
Trail</i>, Little, Brown, Boston, 1931. Hulbert read exhaustively in
the exhausting literature by and about the gold hunters rushing to
California. Then he wove into a synthetic diary the most interesting
and illuminating records on happenings, characters, ambitions, talk,
singing, the whole life of the emigrants.

<p>
IRVING, WASHINGTON. Irving made his ride into what is now Oklahoma in
1832. He had recently returned from a seventeen-year stay in Europe and
was a mature literary man&mdash;as mature as a conforming romanticist could
become Prairie life refreshed him. A <i>Tour on the Prairies</i>, published
in 1835, remains refreshing. It is illuminated by <i>Washington Irving
on the Prairie; or, A Narrative of the Southwest in the Year 1832</i>, by
Henry Leavitt Ellsworth (who accompanied Irving), edited by Stanley
T. Williams and Barbara D. Simison, New York, 1937; by <i>The Western
Journals of Washington Irving</i>, excellently edited by John Francis
McDermott, Norman, Oklahoma, 1944; and by Charles J. Latrobe's <i>The

Experiences among Fur Traders and American Indians on the Mississippi

of Ethnology Bulletin 115, Washington, 1937. The public has not had a
chance at this book, which was printed rather than published. Kurz both
saw and recorded with remarkable vitality. He was an artist and the
volume contains many reproductions of his paintings and drawings. One of
the most readable and illuminating of western journals.

PIKE, ZEBULON M. <i>The Southwestern Expedition of Zebulon M. Pike</i>,
Philadelphia, 1810. The 1895 edition edited by Elliott Coues is the most
useful to students. No edition is in print. Pike's explorations of the
Southwest (1806-7) began while the great Lewis and Clark expedition
(1804-6) was ending. His journal is nothing like so informative as
theirs but is just as readable. <i>The Lost Pathfinder</i> is a biography of
Pike by W. Eugene Hollon, University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 1949.
</p>
<p>
TWAIN, MARK. <i>Roughing It</i>, 1872. Mark Twain was a man who wrote and not
merely a writer in man-form. He was frontier American in all his fibers.
He was drunk with western life at a time when both he and it were
standing on tiptoe watching the sun rise over the misty mountain tops,
and he wrote of what he had seen and lived before he became too sober.
<i>Roughing It</i> comes nearer catching the energy, the youthfulness, the
blooming optimism, the recklessness, the lust for the illimitable in
western life than any other book. It deals largely with mining life, but
the surging vitality of this life as reflected by Mark Twain has been
the chief common denominator of all American frontiers and was as
characteristic of Texas "cattle kings" when grass was free as of
Virginia City "nabobs" in bonanza.

<h2>
    21. Range Life: Cowboys, Cattle, Sheep
</h2>
<p>
THE COWBOY ORIGINATED in Texas. The Texas cowboy, along with the Texas
cowman, was an evolvement from and a blend of the riding, shooting,
frontier-formed southerner, the Mexican-Indian horseback worker with
livestock (the vaquero), and the Spanish open-range rancher. The blend
was not in blood, but in occupational techniques. I have traced this
genesis with more detail in <i>The Longhorns</i>. Compared with evolution
in species, evolution in human affairs is meteor-swift. The driving of
millions of cattle and horses from Texas to stock the whole plains area
of North America while, following the Civil War, it was being denuded of
buffaloes and secured from Indian domination, enabled the Texas cowboy
to set his impress upon the whole ranching industry. The cowboy became
the best-known occupational type that America has given the world. He
exists still and will long exist, though much changed from the original.
His fame derives from the past.
</p>
<p>
Romance, both genuine and spurious, has obscured the realities of range
and trail. The realities themselves have, however, been such that few
riders really belonging to the range wished to lead any other existence.
Only by force of circumstances have they changed "the grass beneath and
the sky above" for a more settled, more confining, and more materially
remunerative way of life. Some of the old-time cowboys were little more
adaptable to change than the Plains Indians; few were less reluctant
to plow or work in houses. Heaven in their dreams was a range better
watered than the one they knew, with grass never stricken by drought,
plenty of fat cattle, the best horses and comrades of their experience,
more of women than they talked about in public, and nothing at all of
golden streets, golden harps, angel wings, and thrones; it was a mere
extension, somewhat improved, of the present. Bankers, manufacturers,
merchants, and mechanics seldom so idealize their own occupations; they
work fifty weeks a year to go free the other two.
</p>
<p>
For every hired man on horseback there have been hundreds of plowmen in
America, and tens of millions of acres of rangelands have been plowed
under, but who can cite a single autobiography of a laborer in the
fields of cotton, of corn, of wheat? Or do coal miners, steelmongers,
workers in oil refineries, factory hands of any kind of factory,
the employees of chain stores and department stores ever write
autobiographies? Many scores of autobiographies have been written by
range men, perhaps half of them by cowboys who never became owners at
all. A high percentage of the autobiographies are in pamphlet form; many
that were written have not been published. The trail drivers of open
range days, nearly all dead now, felt the urge to record experiences
more strongly than their successors. They realized that they had been a
part of an epic life.
</p>
<p>
The fact that the hired man on horseback has been as good a man as the
owner and, on the average, has been a more spirited and eager man
than the hand on foot may afford some explanation of the validity and
vitality of his chroniclings, no matter how crude they be. On the other
hand, the fact that the rich owner and the college-educated aspirant to
be a cowboy soon learned, if they stayed on the range, that <i>a man's
a man for a' that</i> may to some extent account for a certain generous
amplitude of character inherent in their most representative
reminiscences. Sympathy for the life biases my judgment; that judgment,
nevertheless, is that some of the strongest and raciest autobiographic
writing produced by America has been by range men.
</p>
<p>
{illust. caption = Tom Lea, in <i>The Longhorns</i> by J. Frank Dobie (1941)}
</p>
<p>
This is not to say that these chronicles are of a high literary order.
Their writers have generally lacked the maturity of mind, the reflective
wisdom, and the power of observation found in personal narratives of the
highest order. No man who camped with a chuck wagon has written anything
remotely comparable to Charles M. Doughty's <i>Arabia Deserta</i>, a
chronicle at once personal and impersonal, restrainedly subjective and
widely objective, of his life with nomadic Bedouins. Perspective is a
concomitant of civilization. The chronicles of the range that show
perspective have come mostly from educated New Englanders, Englishmen,
and Scots. The great majority of the chronicles are limited in subject
matter to physical activities. They make few concessions to "the desire
of the moth for the star"; they hardly enter the complexities of life,
including those of sex. In one section of the West at one time the
outstanding differences among range men were between owners of sheep and
owners of cattle, the ambition of both being to hog the whole country.
On another area of the range at another time, the outstanding difference
was between little ranchers, many of whom were stealing, and big
ranchers, plenty of whom had stolen. Such differences are not exponents
of the kind of individualism that burns itself into great human
documents.
</p>
<p>
Seldom deeper than the chronicles does range fiction go below physical
surface into reflection, broodings, hungers&mdash;the smolderings deep down
in a cowman oppressed by drought and mortgage sitting in a rocking chair
on a ranch gallery looking at the dust devils and hoping for a cloud;
the goings-on inside a silent cowboy riding away alone from an empty pen
to which he will never return; the streams of consciousness in a silent
man and a silent woman bedded together in a wind-lashed frame house away
out on the lone prairie. The wide range of human interests leaves ample
room for downright, straightaway narratives of the careers of strong
men. If the literature of the range ever matures, however, it will
include keener searchings for meanings and harder struggles for human
truths by writers who strive in "the craft so long to lerne." For
three-quarters of a century the output of fiction on the cowboy has been
tremendous, and it shows little diminution. Mass production inundating
the masses of readers has made it difficult for serious fictionists
writing about range people to get a hearing.
</p>
<p>
The code of the West was concentrated into the code of the range&mdash;and
not all of it by any means depended upon the six-shooter. No one can
comprehend this code without knowing something about the code of the Old
South, whence the Texas cowboy came.
</p>
<p>
Mexican goats make the best eating in Mexico and mohair has made
good money for many ranchers of the Southwest. Goats, goat herders,
goatskins, and wine in goatskins figure in the literature of Spain as
prominently as six-shooters in Blazing Frontier fiction&mdash;and far more
pleasantly. Read George Borrow's <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, one of the
most delectable of travel books. Beyond a few notices of Mexican goat
herders, there is on the subject of goats next to nothing readable in
American writings. Where there is no competition, supremacy is small
distinction; so I should offend no taste by saying that "The Man of
Goats" in my own <i>Tongues of the Monte</i> is about the best there is so
far as goats go.
</p>
<p>
Although sheep are among the most salient facts of range life, they
have, as compared with cattle and horses, been a dim item in the range
tradition. Yet, of less than a dozen books on sheep and sheepmen, more
than half of them are better written than hundreds of books concerning
cowboy life. Mary Austin's <i>The Flock</i> is subtle and beautiful;
Archer B. Gilfillan's <i>Sheep</i> is literature in addition to having much
information; Hughie Call's <i>Golden Fleece</i> is delightful; Winifred
Kupper's <i>The Golden Hoof</i> and <i>Texas Sheepman</i> have charm&mdash;a rare
quality in most books on cows and cow people. Among furnishings in the
cabin of Robert Maudslay, "the Texas Sheepman," were a set of Sir Walter
Scott's works, Shakespeare, and a file of the <i>Illustrated London News</i>.
"A man who read Shakespeare and the <i>Illustrated London News</i> had little
to contribute to
</p>

     Come a ti yi yoopee
     Ti yi ya!"
</pre>
<p>
O. Henry's ranch experiences in Texas were largely confined to a sheep
ranch. The setting of his "Last of the Troubadours" is a sheep ranch. I
nominate it as the best range story in American fiction.
</p>
<p>
"Cowboy Songs" and "Horses" are separate chapters following this. The
literature cited in them is mostly range literature, although precious
little in all the songs rises to the status of poetry. A considerable
part of the literature listed under "Texas Rangers" and "The Bad Man
Tradition" bears on range life.
</p>
<p>
ABBOTT, E. C., and SMITH, HELENA HUNTINGTON. We <i>Pointed Them North</i>,
New York, 1939. Abbott, better known as Teddy Blue, used to give his
address as Three Duce Ranch, Gilt Edge, Montana. Helena Huntington
Smith, who actually wrote and arranged his reminiscences, instead of
currying him down and putting a checkrein on him, spurred him in the
flanks and told him to swaller his head. He did. This book is franker
about the women a rollicky cowboy was likely to meet in town than all
the other range books put together. The fact that Teddy Blue's wife was
a half-breed Indian, daughter of Granville Stuart, and that Indian women
do not object to the truth about sex life may account in part for his
frankness. The book is mighty good reading. OP.
</p>
<p>
ADAMS, ANDY. <i>The Log of a Cowboy</i> (1903). In 1882, at the age of
twenty-three, Andy Adams came to Texas from Indiana. For about ten years
he traded horses and drove them up the trail. He knew cattle people
and their ranges from Brownsville to Caldwell, Kansas. After mining for
another decade, he began to write. If all other books on trail driving
were destroyed, a reader could still get a just and authentic conception
of trail men, trail work, range cattle, cow horses, and the cow country
in general from <i>The Log of a Cowboy</i>. It is a novel without a plot, a
woman, character development, or sustained dramatic incidents; yet it
is the classic of the occupation. It is a simple, straightaway narrative
that takes a trail herd from the Rio Grande to the Canadian line, the
hands talking as naturally as cows chew cuds, every page illuminated
by an easy intimacy with the life. Adams wrote six other books. <i>The
Outlet, A Texas Matchmaker, Cattle Brands</i>, and <i>Reed Anthony, Cowman</i>
all make good reading. <i>Wells Brothers</i> and <i>The Ranch on the Beaver</i>
are stories for boys. I read them with pleasure long after I was grown.
All but <i>The Log of a Cowboy</i> are OP, published by Houghton Mifflin,
Boston.

ADAMS, RAMON F. <i>Cowboy Lingo</i>, Boston, 1936. A dictionary of cowboy
words, figures of speech, picturesque phraseology, slang, etc., with
explanations of many factors peculiar to range life. OP. <i>Western
Words</i>, University of Oklahoma Press, 1944. A companion book. <i>Come an'
Get It</i>, University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 1952. Informal exposition
of chuck wagon cooks.
</p>
<p>
ALDRIDGE, REGINALD. <i>Ranch Notes</i>, London, 1884. Aldridge, an educated
Englishman, got into the cattle business before, in the late eighties,
it boomed itself flat. His book is not important, but it is maybe
a shade better than <i>Ranch Life in Southern Kansas and the Indian
Territory</i> by Benjamin S. Miller, New York, 1896. Aldridge and Miller
were partners, and each writes kindly about the other.
</p>
<p>
ALLEN, JOHN HOUGHTON. <i>Southwest</i>, Lippincott, Philadelphia, 1952. A
chemical compound of highly impressionistic autobiographic nonfiction
and highly romantic fiction and folk tales. The setting is a ranch of
Mexican tradition in the lower border country of Texas, also saloons and
bawdy houses of border towns. Vaqueros and their work in the brush are
intensely vivid. The author has a passion for superlatives and for "a
joyous cruelty, a good cruelty, a young cruelty."

meanings of things; she was a creator. Very quietly she sublimated life
into the literature of pictures and emotions.

Australian ranching is not foreign to American ranching. The best book

<p>
BECHDOLT, FREDERICK R. <i>Tales of the Old Timers</i>, New York, 1924. Vivid,
economical stories of "The Warriors of the Pecos" (Billy the Kid and the
troubles on John Chisum's ranch-empire), of Butch Cassidy and his Wild
Bunch in their Wyoming hide-outs, of the way frontier Texans fought
Mexicans and Comanches over the open ranges. Research clogs the style of
many historians; perhaps it is just as well that Bechdolt did not search
more extensively into the arcana of footnotes. OP.

<p>
BOREIN, EDWARD. <i>Etchings of the West</i>, edited by Edward S. Spaulding,
Santa Barbara, California, 1950. OP. A very handsome folio; primarily a
reproduction of sketches, many of which are on range subjects. Ed
Borein tells more in them than hundreds of windbags have told in tens of
thousands of pages. They are beautiful and authentic, even if they are
what post-impressionists call "documentary." Believers in the True Faith
say now that Leonardo da Vinci is documentary in his painting of the
Lord's Supper. Ed Borein was a great friend of Charlie Russell's but not
an imitator. <i>Etchings of the West</i> will soon be among the rarities of
Western books.
</p>
<p>
BOWER, B. M. <i>Chip of the Flying U</i>, New York, 1904. Charles Russell
illustrated this and three other Bower novels. Contrary to his denial,
he is supposed to have been the prototype for Chip. A long time ago I
read <i>Chit of the Flying U</i> and <i>The Lure of the Dim Trails</i> and thought
them as good as Eugene Manlove Rhodes's stories. That they have faded
almost completely out of memory is a commentary on my memory; just the
same, a character as well named as Chip should, if he have substance
beyond his name, leave an impression even on weak memories. B. M.
Bower was a woman, Bower being the name of her first husband. A Montana
cowpuncher named "Fiddle Back" Sinclair was her second, and Robert
Ellsworth Cowan became the third. Under the name of Bud Cowan he
published a book of reminiscences entitled <i>Range Rider</i> (Garden City,
N. Y., 1930). B. M. Bower wrote a slight introduction to it; neither he
nor she says anything about being married to the other. In the best
of her fiction she is truer to life than he is in a good part of his
nonfiction. Her chaste English is partly explained in an autobiographic
note contributed to <i>Adventure</i> magazine, December 10, 1924. Her
restless father had moved the family from Minnesota to Montana. There,
she wrote, he "taught me music and how to draw plans of houses (he was
an architect among other things) and to read <i>Paradise Lost</i> and Dante
and H. Rider Haggard and the Bible and the Constitution&mdash;and my taste
has been extremely catholic ever since."

BRATT, JOHN. <i>Trails of Yesterday</i>, Chicago, 1921. John Bratt,
twenty-two years old, came to America from England in 1864, went west,
and by 1870 was ranching on the Platte. He became a big operator, but
his reminiscences, beautifully printed, are stronger on camp cooks and
other hired hands than on cattle "kings." Nobody ever heard a cowman
call himself or another cowman a king. "Cattle king" is journalese.

BRISBIN, GENERAL JAMES S. <i>The Beef Bonanza; or, How to Get Rich on the
Plains</i>, Philadelphia, 1881. One of several books of its decade designed

BROOKS, BRYANT B. <i>Memoirs</i>, Gardendale, California, 1939. The book
never was published; it was merely printed to satisfy the senescent
vanity of a property-worshiping, cliche-parroting reactionary who made
money ranching before he became governor of Wyoming. He tells a few good
anecdotes of range days. Numerous better books pertaining to the range
are NOT listed here; this mediocrity represents a particular type.

Especially good on domestic life and on sheepherders. OP.

CANTON, FRANK M. <i>Frontier Trails</i>, edited by E. E. Dale, Boston, 1930.
OP. Good on tough hombres.

<p>
CLAY, JOHN. My <i>Life on the Range</i>, privately printed, Chicago, 1924.
OP. John Clay, an educated Scot, came to Canada in 1879 and in time
managed some of the largest British-owned ranches of North America. His
book is the best of all sources on British-owned ranches. It is just as
good on cowboys and sheepherders. Clay was a fine gentleman in addition
to being a canny businessman in the realm of cattle and land. He
appreciated the beautiful and had a sense of style.

<p>
CLEAVELAND, AGNES MORLEY. <i>No Life for a Lady</i>, Houghton Mifflin,

<p>
COLLINGS, ELLSWORTH. <i>The 101 Ranch</i>, University of Oklahoma Press,

<p>
COLLINS, DENNIS. <i>The Indians' Last Fight or the Dull Knife Raid</i>, Press
of the Appeal to Reason, Girard, Kansas, n.d. Nearly half of this
very scarce book deals autobiographically with frontier range life.
Realistic, strong, written from the perspective of a man who "wanted
something to read" in camp.
</p>
<p>
COLLINS, HUBERT E. <i>Warpath and Cattle Trail</i>, New York, 1928. The
pageant of trail life as it passed by a stage stand in Oklahoma;
autobiographical. Beautifully printed and illustrated. Far better than
numerous other out-of-print books that bring much higher prices in the
second-hand market.
</p>
<p>
CONN, WILLIAM (translator). <i>Cow-Boys and Colonels: Narrative of a
Journey across the Prairie and over the Black Hills of Dakota</i>, London,
1887; New York (1888?). More of a curiosity than an illuminator,
the book is a sparsely annotated translation of <i>Dans les Montagnes
Rocheuses</i>, by Le Baron E. de Mandat-Grancey, Paris, October, 1884. (The
only copy I have examined is of 1889 printing.) It is a gossipy account
of an excursion made in 1883-84; cowboys and ranching are viewed pretty
much as a sophisticated Parisian views a zoo. The author must have
felt more at home with the fantastic Marquis de Mores of Medora, North
Dakota. The book appeared at a time when European capital was being
invested in western ranches. It was followed by <i>La Breche aux Buffles:
Un Ranch Francais dans le Dakota</i>, Paris, 1889. Not translated so far as
I know.

<p>
COOK, JAMES H. <i>Fifty Years on the Old Frontier</i>, 1923. Cook came to
Texas soon after the close of the Civil War and became a brush popper
on the Frio River. Nothing better on cow work in the brush country and
trail driving in the seventies has appeared. OP. A good deal of the
same material was put into Cook's <i>Longhorn Cowboy</i> (Putnam's, 1942), to
which the pushing Mr. Howard R. Driggs attached his name.

Cox, JAMES. <i>The Cattle Industry of Texas and Adjacent Territory</i>, St.
Louis, 1895. Contains many important biographies and much good history.
In 1928 I traded a pair of store-bought boots to my uncle Neville Dobie
for his copy of this book. A man would have to throw in a young Santa
Gertrudis bull now to get a copy.
</p>
<p>
CRAIG, JOHN R. <i>Ranching with lords and Commons</i>, Toronto, 1903. During
the great boom of the early 1880'S in the range business, Craig promoted
a cattle company in London and then managed a ranch in western Canada.
His book is good on mismanaged range business and it is good on people,
especially lords, and the land. He attributes to De Quincey a Latin
quotation that properly, I think, belongs to Thackeray. He quotes Hamlin
Garland: "The trail is poetry; a wagon road is prose; the railroad,
arithmetic." He was probably not so good at ranching as at writing. His
book supplements <i>From Home to Home</i>, by Alex. Staveley Hill, New York,
1885. Hill was a major investor in the Oxley Ranch, and was, I judge,
the pompous cheat and scoundrel that Craig said he was.
</p>
<p>
CRAWFORD, LEWIS F. <i>Rekindling Camp Fires: The Exploits of Ben Arnold
(Connor)</i>, Bismarck, North Dakota, 1926. OP. The skill of Lewis F.
Crawford of the North Dakota Historical Society made this a richer
autobiography than if Arnold had been unaided. He was squaw man, scout,
trapper, soldier, deserter, prospector, and actor in other occupations
as well as cowboy. He had a fierce sense of justice that extended to
Indians. His outlook was wider than that of the average ranch hand.
<i>Badlands and Broncho Trails</i>, Bismarck, 1922, is a slight book of
simple narratives that catches the tune of the Badlands life. OP.
<i>Ranching Days in Dakota</i>, Wirth Brothers, Baltimore, 1950, is good on
horse-raising and the terrible winter of 1886-87.
</p>
<p>
CULLEY, JOHN. <i>Cattle, Horses, and Men</i>, Los Angeles, 1940. Much about
the noted Bell Ranch of New Mexico. Especially good on horses. Culley
was educated at Oxford. When I visited him in California, he had on his
table a presentation copy of a book by Walter Pater. His book has the
luminosity that comes from cultivated intelligence. OP.
</p>
<p>
DACY, GEORGE F. <i>Four Centuries of Florida Ranching</i>, St. Louis, 1940.
OP. In <i>Crooked Trails</i>, Frederic Remington has a chapter (illustrated)
on "Cracker Cowboys of Florida," and <i>Lake Okeechobee</i>, by A. J. Hanna
and Kathryn Abbey, Indianapolis, 1948, treats of modern ranching
in Florida, but the range people of that state have been too
lethargic-minded to write about themselves and no Marjorie Kinnan
Rawlings has settled in their midst to interpret them.

<p>
DAYTON, EDSON C. <i>Dakota Days</i>. Privately printed by the author at
Clifton Springs, New York, 1937&mdash;three hundred copies only. Dayton was
more sheepman than cowman. He had a spiritual content. His very use of
the word <i>intellectual</i> on the second page of his book; his estimate
of Milton and Gladstone, adjacent to talk about a frontier saloon; his
consciousness of his own inner growth&mdash;something no extravert cowboy
ever noticed, usually because he did not have it; his quotation to
express harmony with nature:
</p>
<pre>
          I have some kinship to the bee,
          I am boon brother with the tree;
          The breathing earth is part of me&mdash;

all indicate a refinement that any gambler could safely bet originated
in the East and not in Texas or the South.

DOBIE, J. FRANK. <i>A Vaquero of the Brush Country</i>, 1929. Much on border
troubles over cattle, the "skinning war," running wild cattle in the
brush, mustanging, trail driving; John Young's narrative, told in the
first person, against range backgrounds. <i>The Longhorns</i>, illustrated by
Tom Lea, 1941. History of the Longhorn breed, psychology of stampedes;
days of maverickers and mavericks; stories of individual lead steers
and outlaws of the range; stories about rawhide and many other related
subjects. The book attempts to reveal the blend made by man, beast, and
range. Both books published by Little, Brown, Boston. <i>The Mustangs</i>,

1949. This book could be classified under "The Bad Man Tradition,"

Clearly written from an equable point of view. Useful bibliography of
range books.

GIBSON, J. W. (Watt). <i>Recollections of a Pioneer</i>, St. Joseph, Missouri
(about 1912). Like many another book concerned only incidentally with
range life, this contains essential information on the subject. Here it
is trailing cattle from Missouri to California in the 1840's and
1850's. Cattle driving from the East to California was not economically
important. The outstanding account on the subject is <i>A Log of the
Texas-California Cattle Trail, 1854</i>, by James G. Bell, edited
by J. Evetts Haley, published in the <i>Southwestern Historical
Quarterly</i>, 1932 (Vols. XXXV and XXXVI). Also reprinted as a separate.

HALEY, J. EVETTS. <i>The XIT Ranch of Texas</i>, Chicago, 1929. As county and
town afford the basis for historical treatment of many areas, ranches
have afforded bases for various range country histories. Of such this is
tops. A lawsuit for libel brought by one or more individuals mentioned
in the book put a stop to the selling of copies by the publishers and
made it very "rare." <i>Charles Goodnight, Cowman and Plainsman</i>, Boston,
1936, reissued by University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 1949. Goodnight,
powerful individual and extraordinary observer, summed up in himself the
whole life of range and trail. Haley's book, packed with realities of
incident and character, paints him against a mighty background. <i>George
W. Littlefield, Texan</i>, University of Oklahoma Presss Norman, Okla.,
1943, is a lesser biography of a lesser man.

being literary.

<p>
HENRY, STUART. <i>Our Great American Plains</i>, New York, 1930. OP. An
unworshipful, anti-Philistinic picture of Abilene, Kansas, when it was
at the end of the Chisholm Trail. While not a primary range book, this
is absolutely unique in its analysis of cow-town society, both citizens
and drovers. Stuart Henry came to Abilene as a boy in 1868. His brother
was the first mayor of the town. After graduating from the University
of Kansas in 1881, he in time acquired "the habit of authorship." He
had written a book on London and <i>French Essays and Profiles</i> and <i>Hours
with Famous Parisians</i> before he returned to Kansas for a subject.
Some of his non-complimentary characterizations of westerners aroused
a mighty roar among panegyrists of the West. They did not try to refute
his anecdote about the sign of the Bull Head Saloon. This sign showed
the whole of a great red bull. The citizens of Abilene were used to
seeing bulls driven through town and they could go out any day and
see bulls with cows on the prairie. Nature might be good, but any art
suggesting nature's virility was indecent. There was such an uprising
of Victorian taste that what distinguishes a bull from a cow had to be
painted out. A similar artistic operation had to be performed on the
bull signifying Bull Durham tobacco&mdash;once the range favorite for making
cigarettes.

HORN, TOM. <i>Life of Tom Horn... Written by Himself, together with His
Letters and Statements by His Friends, A Vindication</i>. Published (for
John C. Coble) by the Louthan Book Company, Denver, 1904. Who wrote the
book has been somewhat in debate. John C. Coble's name is signed to the
preface attributing full authorship to Horn. Of Pennsylvania background,
wealthy and educated, he had employed Horn as a stock detective on his
Wyoming ranch. He had the means and ability to see the book through the
press. A letter from his wife to me, from Cheyenne, June 21,1926, says
that Horn wrote the book. Charles H. Coe, who succeeded Horn as stock
detective in Wyoming, says in <i>Juggling a Rope</i> (Pendleton, Oregon,
1927, P. 108), that Horn wrote it. I have a copy, bought from Fred
Rosenstock of the Bargain Book Store in Denver, who got it from Hattie
Horner Louthan, of Denver also. For years she taught English in the
University of Denver, College of Commerce, and is the author of more
than one textbook. The Louthan Book Company of Denver was owned by her
family. This copy of <i>Tom Horn</i> contains her bookplate. On top of the
first page of the preface is written in pencil: "I wrote this&mdash;`Ghost
wrote.' H. H. L." Then, penciled at the top of the first page of
"Closing Word," is "I wrote this."
</p>
<p>
Glendolene Myrtle Kimmell was a schoolteacher in the country where Tom
Horn operated. As her picture shows, she was lush and beautiful. Pages
287-309 print "Miss Kimmell's Statement." She did her best to keep Tom
Horn from hanging. She frankly admired him and, it seems to me, loved
him. Jay Monaghan, <i>The Legend of Tom Horn, Last of the Bad Men</i>,
Indianapolis and New York, 1946, says (p. 267), without discussion or
proof, that after Horn was hanged and buried Miss Kimmell was "writing
a long manuscript about a Sir Galahad horseman who was `crushed between
the grinding stones of two civilizations,' but she never found a
publisher who thought her book would sell. It was entitled <i>The True
Life of Tom Horn</i>."
</p>
<p>
The main debate has been over Horn himself. The books about him are
not highly important, but they contribute to a spectacular and highly
controversial phase of range history, the so-called Johnson County War
of Wyoming. Mercer's <i>Banditti of the Plains</i>, Mokler's <i>History of
Natrona County, Wyoming</i>, Canton's <i>Frontier Trails</i>, and David's
<i>Malcolm Campbell, Sheriff</i> (all listed in this chapter) are primary
sources on the subject.
</p>
<p>
HOUGH, EMERSON. <i>The Story of the Cowboy</i>, New York, 1897. Exposition
not nearly so good as Philip Ashton Rollins' <i>The Cowboy. North of
36</i>, New York, 1923. Historical novel of the Chisholm Trail. The best
character in it is Old Alamo, lead steer. A young woman owner of the
herd trails with it. The success of the romance caused Emerson Hough
to advise his friend Andy Adams to put a woman in a novel about trail
driving&mdash;so Andy Adams told me. Adams replied that a woman with a trail
herd would be as useless as a fifth wheel on a wagon and that he would
not violate reality by having her. For a devastation of Hough's use of
history in <i>North of 36</i> see the Appendix in Stuart Henry's <i>Conquering
Our Great American Plains</i>. Yet the novel does have the right temper.

HUNT, FRAZIER. <i>Cat Mossman: Last of the Great Cowmen</i>, illustrated by
Ross Santee, Hastings House, New York, 1951. Few full-length biographies

Cap Mossman's operations on enormous ranges, but the man.
</p>
<p>
HUNTER, J. MARVIN (compiler). <i>The Trail Drivers of Texas</i>, two volumes,
Bandera, Texas, 1920, 1923. Reprinted in one volume, 1925. All OP.
George W. Saunders, founder of the Old Time Trail Drivers Association
and for many years president, prevailed on hundreds of old-time range
and trail men to write autobiographic sketches. He used to refer to
Volume II as the "second edition"; just the same, he was not ignorant,
and he had a passion for the history of his people. The chronicles,
though chaotic in arrangement, comprise basic source material. An index
to the one-volume edition of <i>The Trail Drivers of Texas</i> is printed as
an appendix to <i>The Chisholm Trail and Other Routes</i>, by T. U. Taylor,
San Antonio, 1936&mdash;a hodgepodge.

<p>
JAMES, WILL. <i>Cowboys North and South</i>, New York, 1924. <i>The Drifting
Cowboy</i>, 1925. <i>Smoky</i>&mdash;a cowhorse story&mdash;1930. Several other books,
mostly repetitious. Will James knew his frijoles, but burned them up
before he died, in 1942. He illustrated all his books. The best one is
his first, written before he became sophisticated with life&mdash;without
becoming in the right way more sophisticated in the arts of drawing
and writing. <i>Lone Cowboy: My Life Story</i> (1930) is without a date or a
geographical location less generalized than the space between Canada and
Mexico.
</p>
<p>
JAMES, W. S. <i>Cowboy Life in Texas</i>, Chicago, 1893. A genuine cowboy who
became a genuine preacher and wrote a book of validity. This is the best
of several books of reminiscences by cowboy preachers, some of whom are
as lacking in the real thing as certain cowboy artists. Next to <i>Cowboy
Life in Texas</i>, in its genre, might come <i>From the Plains to the
Pulpit</i>, by J. W. Anderson, Houston, 1907. The second edition (reset)
has six added chapters. The third, and final, edition, Goose Creek,
Texas, 1922, again reset, has another added chapter. J. B. Cranfill was
a trail driver from a rough range before he became a Baptist preacher
and publisher. His bulky <i>Chronicle, A Story of Life in Texas</i>, 1916, is
downright and concrete.
</p>
<p>
KELEHER, WILLIAM A. <i>Maxwell Land Grant: A New Mexico Item</i>, Santa Fe,
1942. The Maxwell grant of 1,714,764 acres on the Cimarron River was at
one time perhaps the most famous tract of land in the West. This history
brings in ranching only incidentally; it focuses on the land business,
including grabs by Catron, Dorsey, and other affluent politicians.
Perhaps stronger on characters involved during long litigation over
the land, and containing more documentary evidence, is <i>The Grant That
Maxwell Bought</i>, by F. Stanley, The World Press, Denver, 1952 (a folio
of 256 pages in an edition of 250 copies at $15.00). Keleher is a
lawyer; Stanley is a priest. Harvey Fergusson in his historical novel
<i>Grant of Kingdom</i>, New York, 1950, vividly supplements both. Keleher's
second book, <i>The Fabulous Frontier</i>, Rydal, Santa Fe, 1945, illuminates
connections between ranch lands and politicians; principally it sketches
the careers of A. B. Fall, John Chisum, Pat Garrett, Oliver Lee, Jack
Thorp, Gene Rhodes, and other New Mexico notables.
</p>
<p>
KENT, WILLIAM. <i>Reminiscences of Outdoor Life</i>, San Francisco, 1929. OP.
This is far from being a straight-out range book. It is the easy talk of
an urbane man associated with ranches and ranch people who was equally
at home in a Chicago office and among fellow congressmen. He had a
country-going nature and gusto for character.
</p>
<p>
KING, FRANK M. <i>Wranglin' the Past</i>, Los Angeles, 1935. King went all
the way from Texas to California, listening and looking. OP. His second
book, <i>Longhorn Trail Drivers</i> (1940), is worthless. His <i>Pioneer
Western Empire Builders</i> (1946) and <i>Mavericks</i> (1947) are no better.
Most of the contents of these books appeared in <i>Western Livestock

University of Texas Press, Austin, 1951. The edited reminiscences of

LAMPMAN, CLINTON PARKS. <i>The Great Western Trail</i>, New York, 1939. OP.

MCCAULEY, JAMES EMMIT. <i>A Stove-up Cowboy's Story</i>, with Introduction
by John A. Lomas and Illustrations by Tom Lea, Austin, 1943. OP. "My
parents be poor like Job's turkey," McCauley wrote. He was a common
cowhand with uncommon saltiness of speech. He wrote as he talked. "God
pity the wight for whom this vivid, honest story has no interest," John
Lomax pronounced. It is one of several brief books of reminiscences
brought out in small editions in the "Range Life Series," under the
editorship of J. Frank Dobie, by the Texas Folklore Society. The two
others worth having are <i>A Tenderfoot Kid on Gyp Water</i>, by Carl Peters
Benedict (1943) and <i>Ed Nichols Rode a Horse</i>, as told to Ruby Nichols
Cutbirth (1943).

MCCOY, JOSEPH G. <i>Historic Sketches of the Cattle Trade of the West and
Southwest</i>, Kansas City, 1874. In 1867, McCoy established at Abilene,
Kansas, terminus of the Chisholm Trail, the first market upon which
Texas drovers could depend. He went broke and thereupon put his sense,
information, and vinegar into the first of all range histories. It is a
landmark. Of the several reprinted editions, the one preferred is that
edited by Ralph P. Bieber, with an information-packed introduction and
many illuminating notes, Glendale, California, 1940. This is Volume VIII
in the "Southwest Historical Series," edited by Bieber, and the index to
it is included in the general index to the whole series. Available is an
edition published by Long's College Book Co., Columbus, Ohio. About the
best of original sources on McCoy is <i>Twenty Years of Kansas City's Live

<p>
MOKLER, ALFRED JAMES. <i>History of Natrona County, Wyoming, 1888-1922</i>,
Chicago, 1923. Contains some good material on the "Johnson County War."
This book is listed as an illustration of many county histories of
western states containing concrete information on ranching. Other
examples of such county histories are S. D. Butcher's <i>Pioneer History
of Custer County</i> (Nebraska), Broken Bow, Nebraska, 1901; <i>History of
Jack County</i> (Texas), Jacksboro, Texas (about 1935); <i>Historical Sketch
of Parker County and Weatherford, Texas</i>, St. Louis, 1877.

MORA, JO. <i>Trail Dust and Saddle Leather</i>, Scribner's, New York, 1946.
No better exposition anywhere, and here tellingly illustrated, of
reatas, spurs, bits, saddles, and other gear. <i>Californios</i>, Doubleday,
Garden City, N. Y., 1949. Profusely illustrated. Largely on vaquero
techniques. Jo Mora knew the California vaquero, but did not know the
range history of other regions and, therefore, judged as unique what was
widespread.

NIMMO, JOSEPH, JR. <i>The Range and Ranch Cattle Traffic in the
Western States and Territories</i>, Executive Document No. 267, House of
Representatives, 48th Congress, 2nd Session, Washington, D. C., 1885.
Printed also in one or more other government documents. A statistical
record concerning grazing lands, trail driving, railroad shipping of
cattle, markets, foreign investments in ranches, etc. This document
is the outstanding example of factual material to be found in various
government publications, Volume III of the <i>Tenth Census of the United
States</i> (1880) being another. <i>The Western Range: Letter from the
Secretary of Agriculture</i>, etc (a "letter" 620 pages long), United
States Government Printing Office, Washington, 1936, lists many
government publications both state and national.
</p>
<p>
NORDYKE, LEWIS. <i>Cattle Empire</i>, Morrow, New York, 1949. History,
largely political, of the XIT Ranch. Not so careful in documentation as
Haley's <i>XIT Ranch of Texas</i>, and not so detailed on ranch operations,
but thoroughly illuminative on the not-heroic side of big businessmen in
big land deals. The two histories complement each other.
</p>
<p>
O'NEIL, JAMES B. <i>They Die But Once</i>, New York, 1935. The biographical

PENDER, ROSE. A <i>Lady's Experiences in the Wild West in 1883</i>, London
(1883?); second printing with a new preface, 1888. Rose Pender and
two fellow-Englishmen went through Wyoming ranch country, stopping on
ranches, and she, a very intelligent, spirited woman, saw realities that
few other chroniclers suggest. This is a valuable bit of social history.

<p>
PILGRIM, THOMAS (under pseudonym of Arthur Morecamp). <i>Live Boys;
or Charley and Nasho in Texas</i>, Boston, 1878. The chronicle, little
fictionized, of a trail drive to Kansas. So far as I know, this is the
first narrative printed on cattle trailing or cowboy life that is to be
accounted authentic. The book is dated from Kerrville, Texas.

PONTING, TOM CANDY. <i>The Life of Tom Candy Ponting</i>, Decatur, Illinois
1907 reprinted, with Notes and Introduction by Herbert O. Brayer,
by Branding Iron Press, Evanston, Illinois, 1952. An account of buying
cattle in Texas in 1853, driving them to Illinois, and later shipping
some to New York. Accounts of trail driving before about 1870 have been
few and obscurely printed. The stark diary kept by George C. Duffield
of a drive from San Saba County, Texas, to southern Iowa in 1866 is as
realistic&mdash;often agonizing&mdash;as anything extant on this much romanticized
subject. It is published in <i>Annals of Iowa</i>, Des Moines, IV (April,
1924), 243-62.
</p>
<p>
POTTER, JACK. Born in 1864, son of the noted "fighting parson," Andrew
Jackson Potter, Jack became a far-known trail boss and ranch manager.
His first published piece, "Coming Down the Trail," appeared in <i>The
Trail Drivers of Texas</i>, compiled by J. Marvin Hunter, and is about
the livest thing in that monumental collection. Jack Potter wrote for
various Western magazines and newspapers. He was more interested in
cow nature than in gun fights; he had humor and imagination as well as
mastery of facts and a tangy language, though small command over form.
His privately printed booklets are: <i>Lead Steer</i> (with Introduction by
J. Frank Dobie), Clayton, N. M., 1939; <i>Cattle Trails of the Old
West</i> (with map), Clayton, N.M., 1935; <i>Cattle Trails of the Old West</i>

<p>
RHODES, EUGENE MANLOVE. <i>West Is West, Once in the Saddle, Good Men and
True, Stepsons of Light</i>, and other novels. "Gene" Rhodes had the "right
tune." He achieved a style that can be called literary. <i>The Hired Man
on Horseback</i>, by May D. Rhodes, is a biography of the writer. Perhaps
"Paso Por Aqui" will endure as his masterpiece. Rhodes had an intense
loyalty to his land and people; he was as gay, gallant, and witty as
he was earnest. More than most Western writers, Rhodes was conscious of
art. He had the common touch and also he was a writer for writing men.
The elements of simplicity and the right kind of sophistication, always
with generosity and with an unflagging zeal for the rights of human
beings, were mixed in him. The reach of any ample-natured man exceeds
his grasp. Rhodes was ample-natured, but he cannot be classed as great
because his grasp was too often disproportionately short of the long
reach. His fiction becomes increasingly dated.
</p>
<p>
<i>The Best Novels and, Stories of Eugene Manlove Rhodes</i>, edited by Frank
V. Dearing, Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1949, contains an introduction,
with plenty of anecdotes and too much enthusiasm, by J. Frank Dobie.
</p>
<p>
RICHARDS, CLARICE E. A <i>Tenderfoot Bride</i>, Garden City, N. Y., 1920.
The experiences of a ranchman's wife in Colorado. The telling has charm,
warmth, and flexibility. In the way that art is always truer than a
literal report, <i>A Tenderfoot Bride</i> brings out truths of life that the
literalistic <i>A Cowman's Wife</i> by Mary Kidder Rak misses.
</p>
<p>
RICHTER, CONRAD. <i>The Sea of Grass</i>, Knopf, New York, 1937. A poetic
portrait in fiction, with psychological values, of a big cowman and his
wife.

<p>
RICKETTS, W. P. <i>50 Years in the Saddle</i>, Sheridan, Wyoming, 1942. OP.
A natural book with much interesting information. It contains the best
account of trailing cattle from Oregon to Wyoming that I have seen.
</p>
<p>
RIDINGS, SAM P. <i>The Chisholm Trail</i>, 1926. Sam P. Ridings, a lawyer,
published this book himself from Medford, Oklahoma. He had gone over
the land, lived with range men, studied history. A noble book, rich in
anecdote and character. The subtitle reads: "A History of the World's
Greatest Cattle Trail, together with a Description of the Persons, a
Narrative of the Events, and Reminiscences associated with the Same."
OP.
</p>
<p>
ROBINSON, FRANK C. <i>A Ram in a Thicket</i>, Abelard Press, New York, 1950.
Robinson is the author of many Westerns, none of which I have read. This
is an autobiography, here noted because it reveals a maturity of mind
and an awareness of political economy and social evolution hardly
suggested by other writers of Western fiction.
</p>
<p>
ROLLINS, ALICE WELLINGTON. <i>The Story of a Ranch</i>, New York, 1885.
Philip Ashton Rollins (no relation that I know of to Alice Wellington
Rollins) went into Charlie Everitt's bookstore in New York one day and
said, "I want every book with the word <i>cowboy</i> printed in it." <i>The
Story of a Ranch</i> is listed here to illustrate how titles often have
nothing to do with subject. It is without either story or ranch; it is
about some dilettanteish people who go out to a Kansas sheep farm, talk
Chopin, and wash their fingers in finger bowls.
</p>
<p>
ROLLINS, PHILIP ASHTON. <i>The Cowboy</i>, Scribner's, New York, 1924.
Revised, 1936. A scientific exposition; full. Rollins wrote two Western
novels, not important. A wealthy man with ranch experience, he collected
one of the finest libraries of Western books ever assembled by any
individual and presented it to Princeton University.
</p>
<p>
ROLLINSON, JOHN K. <i>Pony Trails in Wyoming</i>, Caldwell, Idaho, 1941. Not
inspired and not indispensable, but honest autobiography. OP. <i>Wyoming
Cattle Trails</i>, Caxton, Caldwell, Idaho, 1948. A more significant book
than the autobiography. Good on trailing cattle from Oregon.
</p>
<p>
ROOSEVELT, THEODORE. <i>Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail</i>, New York, 1888.
Roosevelt understood the West. He became the peg upon which several
range books were hung, Hagedorn's <i>Roosevelt in the Bad Lands</i> and
Lang's <i>Ranching with Roosevelt</i> in particular. A good summing up, with
bibliography, is <i>Roosevelt and the Stockman's Association</i>, by Ray
H. Mattison, pamphlet issued by the State Historical Society of North
Dakota, Bismarck, 1950.
</p>
<p>
RUSH, OSCAR. <i>The Open Range</i>, Salt Lake City, 1930. Reprinted 1936 by
Caxton, Caldwell, Idaho. A sensitive range man's response to natural
things. The subtitle, <i>Bunk House Philosophy</i>, characterizes the book.
</p>
<p>
RUSSELL, CHARLES M. <i>Trails Plowed Under</i>, 1927, with introduction by
Will Rogers. Russell was the greatest painter that ever painted a range
man, a range cow, a range horse or a Plains Indian. He savvied the cow,
the grass, the blizzard, the drought, the wolf, the young puncher in
love with his own shadow, the old waddie remembering rides and thirsts
of far away and long ago. He was a wonderful storyteller, and most of
his pictures tell stories. He never generalized, painting "a man," "a
horse," "a buffalo" in the abstract. His subjects are warm with life,
whether awake or asleep, at a particular instant, under particular
conditions. <i>Trails Plowed Under</i>, prodigally illustrated, is a
collection of yarns and anecdotes saturated with humor and humanity.
It incorporates the materials in two Rawhide Rawlins pamphlets. <i>Good
Medicine</i>, published posthumously, is a collection of Russell's letters,
illustrations saying more than written words.
</p>
<p>
Russell's illustrations have enriched numerous range books, B. M.
Bower's novels, Malcolm S. Mackay's <i>Cow Range and Hunting Trail</i>, and
Patrick T. Tucker's <i>Riding the High Country</i> being outstanding among
them. Tucker's book, autobiography, has a bully chapter on Charlie
Russell. <i>Charles M. Russell, the Cowboy Artist: A Bibliography</i>, by
Karl Yost, Pasadena, California, 1948, is better composed than its
companion biography, <i>Charles M. Russell the Cowboy Artist</i>, by Ramon F.
Adams and Homer E. Britzman. (Both OP.) One of the most concrete pieces
of writing on Russell is a chapter in <i>In the Land of Chinook</i>, by
Al. J. Noyes, Helena, Montana, 1917. "Memories of Charlie Russell," in
<i>Memories of Old Montana</i>, by Con Price, Hollywood, 1945, is also
good. All right as far as it goes, about a rock's throw away, is "The
Conservatism of Charles M. Russell," by J. Frank Dobie, in a portfolio
reproduction of <i>Seven Drawings by Charles M. Russell, with an
Additional Drawing by Tom Lea</i>, printed by Carl Hertzog, 
El Paso 1950.
</p>
<p>
SANTEE, ROSS. <i>Cowboy</i>, 1928. OP. The plotless narrative, reading like
autobiography, of a kid who ran away from a farm in East Texas to be a
cowboy in Arizona. His cowpuncher teachers are the kind "who know what
a cow is thinking of before she knows herself." Passages in <i>Cowboy</i>
combine reality and elemental melody in a way that almost no other
range writer excepting Charles M. Russell has achieved. Santee is a
pen-and-ink artist also. Among his other books, <i>Men and Horses</i> is
about the best.
</p>
<p>
SHAW, JAMES C. <i>North from Texas: Incidents in the Early Life of a
Range Man in Texas, Dakota and Wyoming, 1852-1883</i>, edited by Herbert O.
Brayer. Branding Iron Press, Evanston, Illinois, 1952. Edition limited
to 750 copies. I first met this honest autobiography by long quotations
from it in Virginia Cole Trenholm's <i>Footprints on the Frontier</i>
(Douglas, Wyoming, 1945), wherein I learned that Shaw's narrative had
been privately printed in Cheyenne in 1931, in pamphlet form, for gifts
to a few friends and members of the author's family. I tried to buy a
copy but could find none for sale at any price. This reprint is in a
format suitable to the economical prose, replete with telling incidents
and homely details. It will soon be only a little less scarce than the
original.
</p>
<p>
SHEEDY, DENNIS. <i>The Autobiography of Dennis Sheedy</i>. Privately printed
in Denver, 1922 or 1923. Sixty pages bound in leather and as scarce as
psalm-singing in "fancy houses." The item is not very important in the
realm of range literature but it exemplifies the successful businessman
that the judicious cowman of open range days frequently became.
</p>
<p>
SHEFFY, L. F. <i>The Life and Times of Timothy Dwight Hobart, 1855-1935</i>,
Panhandle-Plains Historical Society, Canyon, Texas, 1950. Hobart was
manager for the large J A Ranch, established by Charles Goodnight.
He had a sense of history. This mature biography treats of important
developments pertaining to ranching in the Texas Panhandle.
</p>
<p>
SIRINGO, CHARLES A. A <i>Texas Cowboy, or Fifteen Years on the Hurricane
Deck of a Spanish Cow Pony</i>, 1885. The first in time of all cowboy
autobiographies and first, also, in plain rollickiness. Siringo later
told the same story with additions under the titles of <i>A Lone Star
Cowboy, A Cowboy Detective</i>, etc., all out of print. Finally, there
appeared his <i>Riata and Spurs</i>, Boston, 1927, a summation and extension
of previous autobiographies. Because of a threatened lawsuit, half of it
had to be cut and additional material provided for a "Revised Edition."
No other cowboy ever talked about himself so much in print; few had more
to talk about. I have said my full say on him in an introduction, which
includes a bibliography, to <i>A Texas Cowboy</i>, published with Tom Lea
illustrations by Sloane, New York, 1950. OP.
</p>
<p>
SMITH, ERWIN E., and HALEY, J. EVETTS. <i>Life on the Texas Range</i>,
photographs by Smith and text by Haley, University of Texas Press,
Austin, 1952. Erwin Smith yearned and studied to be a sculptor. Early in
this century he went with camera to photograph the life of land, cattle,
horses, and men on the big ranches of West Texas. In him feeling and
perspective of artist were fused with technical mastership. "I don't
mean," wrote Tom Lea, "that he made just the best photographs I ever
saw on the subject. I mean the best pictures. That includes paintings,
drawings, prints." On 9 by 12 pages of 100-pound antique finish paper,
the photographs are superbly reproduced. Evetts Haley's introduction
interprets as well as chronicles the life of a strange and tragic man.
The book is easily the finest range book in the realm of the pictorial
ever published.
</p>
<p>
SMITH, WALLACE. <i>Garden of the Sun</i>, Los Angeles, 1939. OP. Despite
the banal title, this is a scholarly work with first-rate chapters on
California horses and ranching in the San Joaquin Valley.
</p>
<p>
SNYDER, A. B., as told to Nellie Snyder Yost. <i>Pinnacle Jake</i>, Caxton,
Caldwell, Idaho, 1951. The setting is Nebraska, Wyoming, and Montana
from the 1880's on. Had Pinnacle Jake kept a diary, his accounts of
range characters, especially camp cooks and range horses, with emphasis
on night horses and outlaws, could not have been fresher or more precise
in detail. Reading this book will not give a new interpretation of open
range work with big outfits, but the aliveness of it in both narrative
and sketch makes it among the best of old-time cowboy reminiscences.
</p>
<p>
SONNICHSEN, C. L. <i>Cowboys and Cattle Kings: Life on the Range Today</i>,
University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 1950. An interviewer's findings
without the historical criticism exemplified by Bernard DeVoto on the
subject of federal-owned ranges (in essays in <i>Harper's Magazine</i> during
the late 1940'S).
</p>
<p>
STANLEY, CLARK, "better known as the Rattlesnake King." <i>The Life
and Adventures of the American Cow-Boy</i>, published by the author at
Providence, Rhode Island, 1897. This pamphlet of forty-one pages, plus
about twenty pages of Snake Oil Liniment advertisements, is one of the
curiosities of cowboy literature. It includes a collection of cowboy
songs, the earliest I know of in time of printing, antedating by eleven
years Jack Thorp's booklet of cowboy songs printed at Estancia, New
Mexico, in 1908. Clark Stanley no doubt used the contents of his
pamphlet in medicine show harangues, thus adding to the cowboy myth. As
time went on, he added scraps of anecdotes and western history, along
with testimonials, to the pamphlet, the latest edition I have seen being
about 1906, printed in Worcester, Massachusetts.
</p>
<p>
STEEDMAN, CHARLES J. <i>Bucking the Sagebrush</i>, New York, 1904. OP.
Charming; much of nature. Illustrated by Russell.

<p>
STEVENS, MONTAGUE. <i>Meet Mr. Grizzly</i>, University of New Mexico Press,
Albuquerque, 1943. Stevens, a Cambridge Englishman, ranched, hunted, and
made deductions. See characterization under "Bears and Bear Hunters."
</p>
<p>
STREETER, FLOYD B. <i>Prairie Trails and Cow Towns</i>, Boston, 1936. OP.
This brings together considerable information on Kansas cow towns.
Primary books on the subject, besides those by Stuart Henry, McCoy,
Vestal, and Wright herewith listed, are <i>The Oklahoma Scout</i>, by
Theodore Baughman, Chicago, 1886; <i>Midnight and Noonday</i>, by G. D.
Freeman, Caldwell, Kansas, 1892; biographies of Wild Bill Hickok,
town marshal; Stuart N. Lake's biography of Wyatt Earp, another noted
marshal; <i>Hard Knocks</i>, by Harry Young, Chicago, 1915, not too prudish
to notice dance hall girls but too Victorian to say much. Many Texas
trail drivers had trouble as well as fun in the cow towns. <i>Life
and Adventures of Ben Thompson</i>, by W. M. Walton, 1884, reprinted at
Bandera, Texas, 1926, gives samples. Thompson was more gambler than
cowboy; various other men who rode from cow camps into town and found
themselves in their element were gamblers and gunmen first and cowboys
only in passing.
</p>
<p>
STUART, GRANVILLE. <i>Forty Years on the Frontier</i>, two volumes,
Cleveland, 1925. Nothing better on the cowboy has ever been written
than the chapter entitled "Cattle Business" in Volume II. A prime work
throughout. OP.
</p>
<p>
THORP, JACK (N. Howard) has a secure place in range literature because
of his contribution in cowboy songs. (See entry under "Cowboy Songs and
Other Ballads.") In 1926 he had printed at Santa Fe a paper-backed book
of 123 pages entitled <i>Tales of the Chuck Wagon</i>, but "didn't sell
more than two or three million copies." Some of the tales are in his
posthumously published reminiscences, <i>Pardner of the Wind</i> (as told
to Neil McCullough Clark, Caxton, Caldwell, Idaho, 1945). This book
is richest on range horses, and will be found listed in the section on
"Horses."
</p>
<p>
TOWNE, CHARLES WAYLAND, and WENTWORTH, EDWARD NORRIS. <i>Shepherd's
Empire</i>, University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 1945. Not firsthand in
the manner of Gilfillan's <i>Sheep</i>, nor charming and light in the manner
of Kupper's <i>The Golden Hoof</i>, but an essayical history, based on
research. The deference paid to Mary Austin's <i>The Flock</i> marks the
author as civilized. Towne wrote the book; Wentworth supplied the
information. Wentworth's own book, <i>America's Sheep Trails</i>, Iowa State
College Press, Ames, 1948, is ponderous, amorphous, and in part, only a
eulogistic "mugbook."
</p>
<p>
TOWNSHEND, R. B. <i>A Tenderfoot in Colorado</i>, London, 1923; <i>The
Tenderfoot in New Mexico</i>, 1924. Delightful as well as faithful.
Literature by an Englishman who translated Tacitus under the spires of
Oxford after he retired from the range.
</p>
<p>
TREADWELL, EDWARD F. <i>The Cattle King</i>, New York, 1931; reissued by
Christopher, Boston. A strong biography of a very strong man&mdash;Henry
Miller of California.
</p>
<p>
TRENHOLM, VIRGINIA COLE. <i>Footprints on the Frontier</i>, Douglas, Wyoming,
1945. OP. The best range material in this book is a reprint of parts of
James C. Shaw's <i>Pioneering in Texas and Wyoming</i>, privately printed at
Cheyenne in 1931.
</p>
<p>
TRUETT, VELMA STEVENS. <i>On the Hoof in Nevada</i>, Gehrett-Truett-Hall, Los
Angeles, 1950. A 613-page album of cattle brands&mdash;priced at $10.00. The
introduction is one of the sparse items on Nevada ranching.
</p>
<p>
TUCKER, PATRICK T. <i>Riding the High Country</i>, Caldwell, Idaho, 1933. A
brave book with much of Charlie Russell in it. OP.
</p>
<p>
VESTAL, STANLEY (pen name for Walter S. Campbell). <i>Queen of Cow Towns,
Dodge City</i>, Harper, New York, 1952. "Bibulous Babylon," "Killing of
Dora Hand," and "Marshals for Breakfast" are chapter titles suggesting
the tenor of the book.
</p>
<p>
<i>Vocabulario y Refranero Criollo</i>, text and illustrations by Tito
Saudibet, Guillermo Kraft Ltda., Buenos Aires, 1945. North American
ranges have called forth nothing to compare with this fully illustrated,
thorough, magnificent history-dictionary of the gaucho world. It stands
out in contrast to American slapdash, puerile-minded pretenses at
dictionary treatises on cowboy life.
</p>
<p>
"He who knows only the history of his own country does not know it." The
cowboy is not a singular type. He was no better rider than the Cossack
of Asia. His counterpart in South America, developed also from
Spanish cattle, Spanish horses, and Spanish techniques, is the gaucho.
Literature on the gaucho is extensive, some of it of a high order.
Primary is <i>Martin Fierro</i>, the epic by Jose Hernandez (published
1872-79). A translation by Walter Owen was published in the United
States in 1936. No combination of knowledge, sympathy, imagination, and
craftsmanship has produced stories and sketches about the cowboy equal
to those on the gaucho by W. H. Hudson, especially in <i>Tales of the
Pampas</i> and <i>Far Away and Long Ago</i>, and by R. B. Cunninghame Graham,
whose writings are dispersed and difficult to come by.
</p>
<p>
WEBB, WALTER PRESCOTT. <i>The Great Plains</i>, Ginn, Boston, 1931. While
this landmark in historical interpretation of the West is by no means
limited to the subject of grazing, it contains a long and penetrating
chapter entitled "The Cattle Kingdom." The book is an analysis of land,
climate, barbed wire, dry farming, wells and windmills, native animal
life, etc. No other work on the plains country goes so meatily into
causes and effects.
</p>
<p>
WELLMAN, PAUL I. <i>The Trampling Herd</i>, Doubleday, Garden City, N. Y.,
1939; reissued, 1951. An attempt to sum up the story of the cattle range
in America.
</p>
<p>
WHITE, STEWART EDWARD. <i>Arizona Nights</i>, 1902. "Rawhide," one of the
stories in this excellent collection, utilizes folk motifs about rawhide
with much skill.
</p>
<p>
WILLIAMS, J. R. <i>Cowboys Out Our Way</i>, with an Introduction by J.
Frank Dobie, Scribner's, New York, 1951. An album reproducing about two
hundred of the realistic, humorous, and human J. R. Williams syndicated
cartoons. This book was preceded by <i>Out Our Way</i>, New York, 1943, and
includes numerous cartoons therein printed. There was an earlier and
less extensive collection. Modest Jim Williams has been progressively
dissatisfied with all his cartoon books&mdash;and with cartoons not in books.
I like them and in my Introduction say why.
</p>
<p>
WISTER, OWEN. <i>The Virginian</i>, 1902. Wister was an outsider looking in.
His hero, "The Virginian," is a cowboy without cows&mdash;like the cowboys
of Eugene Manlove Rhodes; but this hero does not even smell of cows,
whereas Rhodes's men do. Nevertheless, the novel authentically realizes
the code of the range, and it makes such absorbing reading that in fifty
years (1902-52) it sold over 1,600,000 copies, not counting foreign
translations and paper reprints.
</p>

Wister was an urbane Harvard man, of clubs and travels. In 1952 the
University of Wyoming celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the
publication of <i>The Virginian</i>. To mark the event, Frances K. W. Stokes
wrote <i>My Father Owen Wister</i>, a biographical pamphlet including "ten
letters written to his mother during his trip to Wyoming in 1885"&mdash;a
trip that prepared him to write the novel. The pamphlet is published at
Laramie, Wyoming, name of publisher not printed on it.

<p>
WRIGHT, PETER. <i>A Three-Foot Stool</i>, New York and London, 1909. Like
several other Englishmen who went west, Wright had the perspective that
enabled him to comprehend some aspects of ranch life more fully than
many range men who knew nothing but their own environment and times.
He compares the cowboy to the cowherd described by Queen Elizabeth's
Spenser. Into exposition of ranching on the Gila, he interweaves talk
on Arabian afreets, Stevenson's philosophy of adventure, and German
imperialism.

PAMPHLETS
</center>
<p>
Pamphlets are an important source of knowledge in all fields. No
first-class library is without them. Most of them become difficult
to obtain, and some bring higher prices than whole sets of books. Of
numerous pamphlets pertaining to the range, only a few are listed here.
<i>History of the Chisum War, or Life of Ike Fridge</i>, by Ike Fridge,
Electra, Texas (undated), is as compact as jerked beef and as laconic
as conversation in alkali dust. James F. Hinkle, in his <i>Early Days of
a Cowboy on the Pecos</i>, Roswell, New Mexico, 1937, says: "One noticeable
characteristic of the cowpunchers was that they did not talk much." Some
people don't have to talk to say plenty. Hinkle was one of them. At
a reunion of trail drivers in San Antonio in October, 1928, Fred S.
Millard showed me his laboriously written reminiscences. He wanted
them printed. I introduced him to J. Marvin Hunter of Bandera, Texas,
publisher of <i>Frontier Times</i>. I told Hunter not to ruin the English
by trying to correct it, as he had processed many of the earth-born
reminiscences in <i>The Trail Drivers of Texas</i>. He printed Millard's <i>A
Cowpuncher of the Pecos</i> in pamphlet form shortly thereafter. It begins:
"This is a piece I wrote for the Trail Drivers." They would understand
some things on which he was not explicit.
</p>
<p>
About 1940, as he told me, Bob Beverly of Lovington, New Mexico, made a
contract with the proprietor of the town's weekly newspaper to print his
reminiscences. By the time the contractor had set eighty-seven pages
of type he saw that he would lose money if he set any more. He gave Bob
Beverly back more manuscript than he had used and stapled a pamphlet
entitled <i>Hobo of the Rangeland</i>. The philosophy in it is more
interesting to me than the incidents. "The cowboy of the old West worked
in a land that seemed to be grieving over something&mdash;a kind of sadness,
loneliness in a deathly quiet. One not acquainted with the plains could
not understand what effect it had on the mind. It produced a heartache
and a sense of exile."
</p>
<p>
Crudely printed, but printed as the author talked, is <i>The End of the
Long Horn Trail</i>, by A. P. (Ott) Black, Selfridge, North Dakota (August,
1939). As I know from a letter from his <i>compadre</i>, Black was blind and
sixty-nine years old when he dictated his memoirs to a college graduate
who had sense enough to retain the flavor. Black's history is badly
botched, but reading him is like listening. "It took two coons and an
alligator to spend the summer on that cotton plantation.... Cowpunchers
were superstitious about owls. One who rode into my camp one night had
killed a man somewhere and was on the dodge. He was lying down by the
side of the campfire when an owl flew over into some hackberry trees
close by and started hooting. He got up from there right now, got his
horse in, saddled up and rode off into the night."
</p>
<p>
John Alley is&mdash;or was&mdash;a teacher. His <i>Memories of Roundup Days</i>,
University of Oklahoma Press, 1934 (just twenty small pages), is an
appraisal of range men, a criticism of life seldom found in old-timers
who look back. On the other hand, some pamphlets prized by collectors
had as well not have been written. Here is the full title of an example:
<i>An Aged Wanderer, A Life Sketch of J. M. Parker, A Cowboy of the
Western Plains in the Early Days</i>. "Price 40 cents. Headquarters,
Elkhorn Wagon Yard, San Angelo, Texas." It was printed about 1923. When
Parker wrote it he was senile, and there is no evidence that he was
ever possessed of intelligence. The itching to get into print does not
guarantee that the itcher has anything worth printing.
</p>
<p>
Some of the best reminiscences have been pried out of range men. In 1914
the Wyoming Stock Growers Association resolved a Historical Commission
into existence. A committee was appointed and, naturally, one man did
the work. In 1923 a fifty-five-page pamphlet entitled <i>Letters from
Old Friends and Members of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association</i> was
printed at Cheyenne. It is made up of unusually informing and pungent
recollections by intelligent cowmen.

    22. Cowboy Songs and Other Ballads

<p>

</p>
<p>
COWBOY SONGS and ballads are generally ranked alongside Negro spirituals
as being the most important of America's contributions to folk song. As
compared with the old English and Scottish ballads, the cowboy and
all other ballads of the American frontiers generally sound cheap and
shoddy. Since John A. Lomax brought out his collection in 1910, cowboy
songs have found their way into scores of songbooks, have been
recorded on hundreds of records, and have been popularized, often&mdash;and
naturally&mdash;without any semblance to cowboy style, by thousands of radio
singers. Two general anthologies are recommended especially for the
cowboy songs they contain: <i>American Ballads and Folk Songs</i>, by John
A. and Alan Lomax, Macmillan, New York, 1934; <i>The American Songbag</i>, by
Carl Sandburg, Harcourt, Brace, New York, 1927.
</p>
<p>
LARRIN, MARGARET. <i>Singing Cowboy</i> (with music), New York, 1931. OP.
</p>
<p>
LOMAX, JOHN A., and LOMAX, ALAN. <i>Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier
Ballads</i>, Macmillan, New York, 1938. This is a much added-to and revised
form of Lomax's 1910 collection, under the same title. It is the most
complete of all anthologies. More than any other man, John A. Lomax is
responsible for having made cowboy songs a part of the common heritage
of America. His autobiographic <i>Adventures of a Ballad Hunter</i>
(Macmillan, 1947) is in quality far above the jingles that most cowboy
songs are.
</p>
<p>
Missouri, as no other state, gave to the West and Southwest. Much of
Missouri is still more southwestern in character than much of Oklahoma.
For a full collection, with full treatment, of the ballads and songs,
including bad-man and cowboy songs, sung in the Southwest there is
nothing better than <i>Ozark Folksongs</i>, collected and edited by Vance
Randolph, State Historical Society of Missouri, Columbia, 1946-50. An
unsurpassed work in four handsome volumes.

OWENS, WILLIAM A. <i>Texas Folk Songs</i>, Southern Methodist University
Press, Dallas, 1950. A miscellany of British ballads, American ballads,
"songs of doleful love," etc. collected in Texas mostly from country
people of Anglo-American stock. Musical scores for all the songs.
</p>
<p>
The Texas Folklore Society has published many cowboy songs. Its
publications <i>Texas and Southwestern Lore</i> (1927) and <i>Follow de
Drinkin' Gou'd</i> (1928) contain scores, with music and anecdotal
interpretations. Other volumes contain other kinds of songs, including
Mexican.
</p>
<p>
THORP, JACK (N. Howard). <i>Songs of the Cowboys</i>, Boston, 1921. OP. Good,
though limited, anthology, without music and with illuminating comments.
A pamphlet collection that Thorp privately printed at Estancia, New
Mexico, in 1908, was one of the first to be published. Thorp had the
perspective of both range and civilization. He was a kind of troubadour
himself. The opening chapter, "Banjo in the Cow Camps," of his
posthumous reminiscences, <i>Pardner of the Wind, is</i> delicious.

    23. Horses: Mustangs and Cow Ponies
</h2>
<p>
THE WEST WAS DISCOVERED, battled over, and won by men on horseback.
Spanish conquistadores saddled their horses in Vera Cruz and rode until
they had mapped the continents from the Horn to Montana and from the
Floridas to the harbors of the Californias. The padres with them rode on
horseback, too, and made every mission a horse ranch. The national dance
of Mexico, the Jarabe, is an interpretation of the clicking of hoofs and
the pawing and prancing of spirited horses that the Aztecs noted when
the Spaniards came. Likewise, the chief contribution made by white
men of America to the folk songs of the world&mdash;the cowboy songs&mdash;are
rhythmed to the walk of horses.
</p>
<p>
Astride horses introduced by the conquistadores to the Americas, the
Plains Indians became almost a separate race from the foot-moving tribes
of the East and the stationary Pueblos of the Rockies. The men that
later conquered and corralled these wild-riding Plains Indians were
plainsmen on horses and cavalrymen. The earliest American explorers and
trappers of both Plains and Rocky Mountains went out in the saddle. The
first industrial link between the East and the West was a mounted pack
train beating out the Santa Fe Trail. On west beyond the end of this
trail, in Spanish California, even the drivers of oxen rode horseback.
The first transcontinental express was the Pony Express.
</p>
<p>
Outlaws and bad men were called "long riders." The Texas Ranger who
followed them was, according to his own proverb, "no better than his
horse." Booted sheriffs from Brownsville on the Rio Grande to the Hole
in the Wall in the Big Horn Mountains lived in the saddle. Climactic of
all the riders rode the cowboy, who lived with horse and herd.
</p>
<p>
In the Old West the phrase "left afoot" meant nothing short of being
left flat on your back. "A man on foot is no man at all," the saying
went. If an enemy could not take a man's life, the next best thing was
to take his horse. Where cow thieves went scot free, horse thieves were
hanged, and to say that a man was "as common as a horse thief" was to
express the nadir of commonness. The pillow of the frontiersmen who
slept with a six-shooter under it was a saddle, and hitched to the horn
was the loose end of a stake rope. Just as "Colonel Colt" made all
men equal in a fight, the horse made all men equal in swiftness and
mobility.
</p>
<p>
The proudest names of civilized languages when literally translated mean
"horseman": eques, caballero, chevalier, cavalier. Until just yesterday
the Man on Horseback had been for centuries the symbol of power and
pride. The advent of the horse, from Spanish sources, so changed the
ways and psychology of the Plains Indians that they entered into what
historians call the Age of Horse Culture. Almost until the automobile
came, the whole West and Southwest were dominated by a Horse Culture.
</p>
<p>
Material on range horses is scattered through the books listed under
"Range Life," "Stagecoaches, Freighting," "Pony Express."
</p>
<p>
No thorough comprehension of the Spanish horse of the Americas is
possible without consideration of this horse's antecedents, and that
involves a good deal of the horse history of the world.

DOBIE, J. FRANK. <i>The Mustangs</i>, illustrated by Charles Banks Wilson,
Little, Brown, Boston, 1952. Before this handsome book arrives at
the wild horses of North America, a third of it has been spent on the
Arabian progenitors of the Spanish horse, the acquisition of the Spanish
horse by western Indians, and the nature of Indian horses. There are
many narratives of mustangs and mustangers and of Spanish-blooded horses
under the saddle. The author has tried to compass the natural history of
the animal and to blend vividness with learning. The book incorporates
his <i>Tales of the Mustang</i>, a slight volume published in an edition of
only three hundred copies in 1936. It also incorporates a large part of
<i>Mustangs and Cow Horses</i>, edited by Dobie, Boatright, and Ransom, and

    24. The Bad Man Tradition
</h2>
<p>
PLENTY of six-shooter play is to be found in most of the books about
old-time cowboys; yet hardly one of the professional bad men was a
representative cowboy. Bad men of the West and cowboys alike wore
six-shooters and spurs; they drank each other's coffee; they had a
fanatical passion for liberty&mdash;for themselves. But the representative
cowboy was a reliable hand, hanging through drought, blizzard, and high
water to his herd, whereas the bona fide bad man lived on the dodge.
Between the killer and the cowboy standing up for his rights or merely
shooting out the lights for fun, there was as much difference as between
Adolf Hitler and Winston Churchill. Of course, the elements were mixed
in the worst of the bad men, as they are in the best of all good men. No
matter what deductions analysis may lead to, the fact remains that the
western bad men of open range days have become a part of the American
tradition. They represent six-shooter culture at its zenith&mdash;the wild
and woolly side of the West&mdash;a stage between receding bowie knife
individualism of the backwoods and blackguard, machine-gun gangsterism
of the city.
</p>
<p>
The songs about Sam Bass, Jesse James, and Billy the Kid reflect popular
attitude toward the hard-riding outlaws. Sam Bass, Jesse James, Billy
the Kid, the Daltons, Cole Younger, Joaquin Murrieta, John Wesley
Hardin, Al Jennings, Belle Starr, and other "long riders" with their
guns in their hands have had their biographies written over and over.
They were not nearly as immoral as certain newspaper columnists lying
under the cloak of piety. As time goes on, they, like antique
Robin Hood and the late Pancho Villa, recede from all realistic
judgment. If the picture show finds in them models for generosity,
gallantry, and fidelity to a code of liberty, and if the public finds
them picturesque, then philosophers may well be thankful that they
lived, rode, and shot.

"The long-tailed heroes of the revolver," to pick a phrase from Mark
Twain's unreverential treatment of them in <i>Roughing It</i>, often
did society a service in shooting each other&mdash;aside from providing
entertainment to future generations. As "The Old Cattleman" of Alfred
Henry Lewis' <i>Wolfville</i> stories says, "A heap of people need a heap
of killing." Nor can the bad men be logically segregated from the
long-haired killers on the side of the law like Wild Bill Hickok and
Wyatt Earp. W. H. Hudson once advanced the theory that bloodshed and
morality go together. If American civilization proceeds, the rage for
collecting books on bad men will probably subside until a copy of Miguel
Antonio Otero's <i>The Real Billy the Kid</i> will bring no higher price
than a first edition of A. Edward Newton's <i>The Amenities of
Book-Collecting</i>.

BILLY THE KID. We ve got to take him seriously, not so much for what he
was&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
     There are twenty-one men I have put bullets through,
     And Sheriff Pat Garrett must make twenty-two&mdash;
</pre>
<p>
as for his provocations. Popular imagination, represented by writers of
all degrees, goes on playing on him with cumulative effect. As a figure
in literature the Kid has come to lead the whole field of western
bad men. The <i>Saturday Review</i>, for October 11, 1952, features a
philosophical essay entitled "Billy the Kid: Faust in America&mdash;The
Making of a Legend." The growth of this legend is minutely traced
through a period of seventy-one years (1881-1952) by J. C. Dykes in
<i>Billy the Kid: The Bibliography of a Legend</i>, University of New Mexico
Press, Albuquerque, 1952 (186 pages). It lists 437 titles, including
magazine pieces, mimeographed plays, motion pictures, verses, pamphlets,
fiction. In a blend of casualness and scholarship, it gives the
substance and character of each item. Indeed, this bibliography reads
like a continued story, with constant references to both antecedent
and subsequent action. Pat Garrett, John Chisum, and other related
characters weave all through it. A first-class bibliography that is also
readable is almost a new genre.
</p>
<p>
Pat F. Garrett, sheriff of Lincoln County, New Mexico, killed the Kid
about midnight, July 14, 1881. The next spring his <i>Authentic Life
of Billy the Kid</i> was published at Santa Fe, at least partly written,
according to good evidence, by a newspaperman named Ash Upton. This
biography is one of the rarities in Western Americana. In 1927 it was
republished by Macmillan, New York, under title of <i>Pat F. Garrett's
Authentic Life of Billy the Kid</i>, edited by Maurice G. Fulton. This is
now OP but remains basic. The most widely circulated biography has been
<i>The Saga of Billy the Kid</i> by Walter Noble Burns, New York, 1926.
It contains a deal of fictional conversation and it has no doubt
contributed to the Robin-Hoodizing of the lethal character baptized as
William H. Bonney, who was born in New York in 1859 and now lives with
undiminished vigor as Billy the Kid. Walter Noble Burns was not so
successful with <i>The Robin Hood of El Dorado: The Saga of Joaquin
Murrieta</i> (1932), or, despite hogsheads of blood, with <i>Tombstone</i>
(1927).

    25. Mining and Oil
</h2>
<p>
DURING the twentieth century oil has brought so much money to the
Southwest that the proceeds from cattle have come to look like tips.
This statement is not based on statistics, though statistics no doubt
exist&mdash;even on the cost of catching sun perch. Geological, legal, and
economic writings on oil are mountainous in quantity, but the human
drama of oil yet remains, for the most part, to be written. It is odd
to find such a modern book as Erna Fergusson's <i>Our Southwest</i> not
mentioning oil. It is odd that no book of national reputation comes off
the presses about any aspect of oil. The nearest to national notice on
oil is the daily report of transactions on the New York Stock Exchange.
Oil companies subsidize histories of themselves, endow universities with
money to train technicians they want, control state legislatures and
senates, and dictate to Congress what they want for themselves in income
tax laws; but so far they have not been able to hire anybody to write
a book about oil that anybody but the hirers themselves wants to read.
Probably they don't read them. The first thing an oilman does after
amassing a few millions is buy a ranch on which he can get away from
oil&mdash;and on which he can spend some of his oil money.
</p>
<p>
People live a good deal by tradition and fight a good deal by tradition
also, voting more by prejudice. When one considers the stream of cow
country books and the romance of mining living on in legends of lost
mines and, then, the desert of oil books, one realizes that it takes
something more than money to make the mare of romance run. Geology and
economics are beyond the aim of this <i>Guide</i>, but if oil money keeps on
buying up ranch land, the history of modern ranching will be resolved
into the biographies of a comparatively few oilmen.

    26. Nature; Wild Life; Naturalists
</h2>
<p>
"NO MAN," says Mary Austin, "has ever really entered into the heart of
any country until he has adopted or made up myths about its familiar
objects." A man might reject the myths but he would have to know many
facts about its natural life and have imagination as well as knowledge
before entering into a country's heart. The history of any land begins
with nature, and all histories must end with nature.
</p>
<p>
"The character of a country is the destiny of its people," wrote Harvey
Fergusson in <i>Rio Grande</i>. Ross Calvin, also of New Mexico, had the same
idea in mind when he entitled his book <i>Sky Determines</i>. "Culture
mocks at the boundaries set up by politics," Clark Wissler said. "It
approaches geographical boundaries with its hat in its hand." The
engineering of water across mountains, electric translation of sounds,
refrigeration of air and foods, and other technical developments carry
human beings a certain distance across some of nature's boundaries, but
no cleverness of science can escape nature. The inhabitants of Yuma,
Arizona, are destined forever to face a desert devoid of graciousness.
Technology does not create matter; it merely uses matter in a skilful
way&mdash;uses it up.
</p>
<p>
Man advances by learning the secrets of nature and taking advantage of
his knowledge. He is deeply happy only when in harmony with his work
and environments. The backwoodsman, early settler, pioneer plainsman,
mountain man were all like some infuriated beast of Promethean
capabilities tearing at its own vitals. Driven by an irrational energy,
they seemed intent on destroying not only the growth of the soil but the
power of the soil to reproduce. Davy Crockett, the great bear killer,
was "wrathy to kill a bear," and as respects bears and other wild life,
one may search the chronicles of his kind in vain for anything beyond
the incidents of chase and slaughter. To quote T. B. Thorpe's blusterous
bear hunter, the whole matter may be summed up in one sentence: "A bear
is started and he is killed." For the average American of the soil,
whether wearing out a farm, shotgunning with a headlight the last doe
of a woodland, shooting the last buffalo on the range, trapping the
last howling lobo, winging the last prairie chicken, running down in an
automobile the last antelope, making a killer's target of any hooting
owl or flying heron that comes within range, poisoning the last eagle to
fly over a sheep pasture for him the circumstances of the killing have
expressed his chief intellectual interest in nature.
</p>
<p>
A sure sign of advancing civilization has been the rapidly changing
popular attitude toward nature during recent years. People are becoming
increasingly interested not merely in conserving game for sportsmen
to shoot, but in preserving all wild life, in observing animals, in
cultivating native flora, in building houses that harmonize with climate
and landscape. Roger Tory Peterson's <i>Field Guide to the Birds</i> has
become one of the popular standard works of America.
</p>
<p>
The story of the American Indian is&mdash;despite taboos and squalor&mdash;a story
of harmonizations with nature. "Wolf Brother," in <i>Long Lance</i>, by Chief
Buffalo Child Long Lance, is a poetic concretion of this harmony. As
much at ease with the wilderness as any Blackfoot Indian was George
Frederick Ruxton, educated English officer and gentleman, who rode
horseback from Vera Cruz to the Missouri River and wrote <i>Adventures
in Mexico and the Rocky Mountains</i>. In this book he tells how a lobo
followed him for days from camp to camp, waiting each evening for his
share of fresh meat and sometimes coming close to the fire at night. Any
orthodox American would have shot the lobo at first appearance. Ruxton
had the civilized perspective on nature represented by Thoreau and Saint
Francis of Assisi. Primitive harmony was run over by frontier wrath to
kill, a wrath no less barbaric than primitive superstitions.
</p>
<p>
But the coyote's howl is more tonic than all theories about nature; the
buck's whistle more invigorating; the bull's bellow in the canyon more
musical; the call of the bobwhite more serene; the rattling of the
rattlesnake more logical; the scream of the panther more arousing to the
imagination; the odor from the skunk more lingering; the sweep of the
buzzard in the air more majestical; the wariness of the wild turkey
brighter; the bark of the prairie dog lighter; the guesses of the
armadillo more comical; the upward dartings and dippings of the
scissortail more lovely; the flight of the sandhill cranes more fraught
with mystery.
</p>
<p>
There is an abundance of printed information on the animal life of
America, to the west as well as to the east. Much of it cannot be
segregated; the earthworm, on which Darwin wrote a book, knows nothing
of regionalism. The best books on nature come from and lead to the
Grasshopper's Library, which is free to all consultants. I advise the
consultant to listen to the owl's hoot for wisdom, plant nine bean rows
for peace, and, with Wordsworth, sit on an old gray stone listening for
"authentic tidings of invisible things." Studies are only to "perfect
nature." In the words of Mary Austin, "They that make the sun noise
shall not fail of the sun's full recompense."
</p>
<p>
Like knowledge in any other department of life, that on nature never
comes to a stand so long as it has vitality. A continuing interest
in natural history is nurtured by <i>Natural History</i>, published by the
American Museum of Natural History, New York; <i>Nature</i>, published
in Washington, D. C.; <i>The Living Wilderness</i>, also from Washington;
<i>Journal of Mammalogy</i>, a quarterly, Baltimore, Maryland; <i>Audubon
Magazine</i> (formerly <i>Bird Lore</i>), published by the National Audubon
Society, New York; <i>American Forests</i>, Washington, D. C., and various
other publications.
</p>
<p>
In addition to books of natural history interest listed below, others
are listed under "Buffaloes and Buffalo Hunters," "Bears and Bear
Hunters," "Coyotes, Lobos, and Panthers," "Birds and Wild Flowers," and
"Interpreters." Perhaps a majority of worthy books pertaining to the
western half of America look on the outdoors.

BEDICHEK, ROY. <i>Adventures with a Texas Naturalist</i>, Doubleday, Garden
City, N. Y., 1947. To be personal, Roy Bedichek has the most richly
stored mind I have ever met; it is as active as it is full. Liberal in
the true sense of the word, it frees other minds. Here, using facts as a
means, it gives meanings to the hackberry tree, limestone, mockingbird,
Inca dove, Mexican primrose, golden eagle, the Davis Mountains, cedar
cutters, and many another natural phenomenon. <i>Adventures with a Texas
Naturalist</i> is regarded by some good judges as the wisest book in the
realm of natural history produced in America since Thoreau wrote.
</p>
<p>
The title of Bedichek's second book, <i>Karankaway Country</i> (Garden City,
1950), is misleading. The Karankawa Indians start it off, but it goes to
coon inquisitiveness, prairie chicken dances, the extinction of species
to which the whooping crane is approaching, browsing goats, dignified
skunks, swifts in love flight, a camp in the brush, dust, erosion,
silt&mdash;always with thinking added to seeing. The foremost naturalist of
the Southwest, Bedichek constantly relates nature to civilization and
human values.

    27. Buffaloes and Buffalo Hunters
</h2>
<p>
THE LITERATURE on the American bison, more popularly called buffalo,
is enormous. Nearly everything of consequence pertaining to the Plains
Indians touches the animal. The relationship of the Indian to the
buffalo has nowhere been better stated than in Note 49 to the Benavides
<i>Memorial</i>, edited by Hodge and Lummis. "The Great Buffalo Hunt at
Standing Rock," a chapter in <i>My Friend the Indian</i> by James McLaughlin,
sums up the hunting procedure; other outstanding treatments of the
buffalo in Indian books are to be found in <i>Long Lance</i> by Chief Buffalo
Child Long Lance; <i>Letters and Notes on... the North American Indians</i>
by George Catlin; <i>Forty Years a Fur Trader</i> by Charles Larpenteur.
Floyd B. Streeter's chapter on "The Buffalo Range" in <i>Prairie Trails
and Cow Towns</i> lists twenty-five sources of information.
</p>
<p>
The bibliography that supersedes all other bibliographies is in the book
that supersedes all other books on the subject&mdash;Frank Gilbert Roe's <i>The
North American Buffalo</i>. More about it in the list that follows.
</p>
<p>
Nearly all men who got out on the plains were "wrathy to kill"
buffaloes above all else. The Indians killed in great numbers but seldom
wastefully. The Spaniards were restrained by Indian hostility. Mountain
men, emigrants crossing the plains, Santa Fe traders, railroad builders,
Indian fighters, settlers on the edge of the plains, European sportsmen,
all slaughtered and slew. Some observed, but the average American
hunter's observations on game animals are about as illuminating as the
trophy-stuffed den of a rich oilman or the lockers of a packing house.
Lawrence of Arabia won his name through knowledge and understanding of
Arabian life and through power to lead and to write. Buffalo Bill won
his name through power to exterminate buffaloes. He was a buffalo man in
the way that Hitler was a Polish Jew man.

It is a pleasure to note the writings of sportsmen with inquiring minds
and of scientists and artists who hunted. Three examples are: <i>The
English Sportsman in the Western Prairies</i>, by the Hon. Grantley F.
Berkeley, London, 1861; <i>Travels in the Interior of North America,
1833-1834</i>, by Maximilian, Prince of Wied (original edition, 1843),
included in that "incomparable storehouse of buffalo lore from early
eye-witnesses," <i>Early Western Travels</i>, edited by Reuben Gold
Thwaites; George Catlin's <i>Letters and Notes on the Manners, Customs and
Conditions of the North American Indians</i>, London, 1841.

<p>
Three aspects of the buffalo stand out: the natural history of the great
American animal; the interrelationship between Indian and buffalo; the
white hunter&mdash;and exterminator.

GRINNELL, GEORGE BIRD (1849-1938) may be classed next to J. A. Allen and
W. T. Hornaday as historian of the buffalo. His primary sources were the
buffaloed plains and the Plains Indians, whom he knew intimately. "In
Buffalo Days" is a long and excellent essay by him in <i>American Big-Game
Hunting</i>, edited by Theodore Roosevelt and George Bird Grinnell, New
York, 1893. He has another long essay, "The Bison," in <i>Musk-Ox, Bison,
Sheep and Goat</i> by Caspar Whitney, George Bird Grinnell, and Owen
Wister, New York, 1904. His noble and beautifully simple <i>When Buffalo
Ran</i>, New Haven, 1920, is specific on work from a buffalo horse. Again

is rich not only on the animal but on the Plains Indian relationship to
it. All OP.

    28. Bears and Bear Hunters
</h2>
<p>
THE BEAR, whether black or grizzly, is a great American citizen. Think
of how many children have been put to sleep with bear stories! Facts
about the animal are fascinating; the effect he has had on the minds of
human beings associated with him transcends naturalistic facts. The tree
on which Daniel Boone carved the naked fact that here he "Killed A. Bar
In the YEAR 1760" will never die. Davy Crockett killed 105 bars in one
season, and his reputation as a bar hunter, plus ability to tell about
his exploits, sent him to Congress. He had no other reason for going.
The grizzly was the hero of western tribes of Indians from Alaska
on down into the Sierra Madre. Among western white men who met him,
occasionally in death, the grizzly inspired a mighty saga, the cantos of
which lie dispersed in homely chronicles and unrecorded memories as well
as in certain vivid narratives by Ernest Thompson Seton, Hittell's John
Capen Adams, John G. Neihardt, and others.
</p>
<p>
For all that, neither the black bear nor the grizzly has been amply
conceived of as an American character. The conception must include a
vast amount of folklore. In a chapter on "Bars and Bar Hunters" in <i>On
the Open Range</i> and in "Juan Oso" and "Under the Sign of Ursa Major,"
chapters of <i>Tongues of the Monte</i>, I have indicated the nature of this
dispersed epic in folk tales.
</p>
<p>
In many of the books listed under "Nature; Wild Life; Naturalists" and
"Mountain Men" the bear "walks like a man."

deductions on observed data, his book is about the most mature yet
published by a ranchman. Goodnight experienced more, had a more ample
nature, but he lacked the perspective, the mental training, to know what
to make of his observations. Another English rancher, R. B. Townshend,
had perspective and charm but was not a scientific observer. So far as
sense of smell goes, <i>Meet Mr. Grizzly</i> is as good as W. H. Hudson's <i>A

better than <i>The Grizzly</i> by Enos Mills.

Wright had a passion for bears, for their preservation, and for arousing
informed sympathy in other people. Yet he did not descend to propaganda.
<i>His The Black Bear</i>, London, n.d., is good but no peer to his work on
the grizzly. Also OP.

<h2>
    29. Coyotes, Lobos, and Panthers
</h2>
<p>
I SEPARATE COYOTES, lobos, and panthers from the mass of animals because
they, along with bears, have made such an imprint on human imagination.
White-tailed deer are far more common and more widely dispersed. Men,
women also, by the tens of thousands go out with rifles every fall in
efforts to get near them; but the night-piercing howl and the cunning
ways of the coyote, the panther's track and the rumor of his scream have
inspired more folk tales than all the deer.
</p>
<p>
Lore and facts about these animals are dispersed in many books not
classifiable under natural history. Lewis and Clark and nearly all the
other chroniclers of Trans-Mississippi America set down much on wild
life. James Pike's <i>Scout and Ranger</i> details the manner in which,
he says, a panther covered him up alive, duplicating a fanciful and
delightful tale in Gerstaecker's <i>Wild Sports in the Far West</i>. James
B. O'Neil concludes <i>They Die but Once</i> with some "Bedtime Stories"
that&mdash;almost necessarily&mdash;bring in a man-hungry panther.
</p>
<center>
COYOTES AND LOBOS
</center>
<p>
The two full-length books on Brother Coyote listed below specify most of
the printed literature on the animal. (He is "Brother" in Mexican tales
and I feel much more brotherly toward him than I feel toward character
assassins in political power.) It would require another book to
catalogue in detail all the writings that include folk tales about Don
Coyote. Ethnologists and scientific folklorists recognize what they call
"the Coyote Circle" in the folklore of many tribes of Indians. Morris
Edward Opler in <i>Myths and Legends of the Lipan Apache Indians</i>, 1940,
and in <i>Myths and Tales of the Chiricahua Apache Indians</i>, 1942 (both
issued by the American Folklore Society, New York) treats fully of
this cycle. Numerous tales that belong to the cycle are included by J.
Gilbert McAllister, an anthropologist who writes as a humanist, in his
extended collection, "Kiowa-Apache Tales," in <i>The Sky Is My Tipi</i>,
edited by Mody C. Boatright for the Texas Folklore Society (Publication
XXII), Southern Methodist University Press, Dallas, 1949.
</p>
<p>
Literary retellers of Indian coyote folk tales have been many. The
majority of retellers from western Indians include Coyote. One of the
very best is Frank B. Linderman, in <i>Indian Why Stories</i> and <i>Indian
Old-Man Stories</i>. These titles are substantive: <i>Old Man Coyote</i> by
Clara Kern Bayliss (New York, 1908, OP), <i>Coyote Stories</i> by Mourning
Dove (Caldwell, Idaho, 1934, OP); <i>Don Coyote</i> by Leigh Peck (Boston,
1941) gets farther away from the Indian, is more juvenile. The <i>Journal
of American Folklore</i> and numerous Mexican books have published hundreds
of coyote folk tales from Mexico. Among the most pleasingly told
are <i>Picture Tales frown Mexico</i> by Dan Storm, 1941 (Lippincott,
Philadelphia). The first two writers listed below bring in folklore.
</p>
<p>
CUSHING, FRANK HAMILTON. <i>Zuni Breadstuff</i>, Museum of the American
Indian, Heye Foundation, New York, 1920. This extraordinary book, one of
the most extraordinary ever written on a particular people, is not made
up of coyote lore alone. In it the coyote becomes a character of
dignity and destiny, and the telling is epic in dignity as well as
in prolongation. Frank Hamilton Cushing was a genius; his sympathy,
insight, knowledge, and mastery of the art of writing enabled him to
reveal the spirit of the Zuni Indians as almost no other writer has
revealed the spirit of any other tribe. Their attitude toward Coyote
is beautifully developed. Cushing's <i>Zuni Folk Tales</i> (Knopf, New York,
1901, 1931) is climactic on "tellings" about Coyote.
</p>
<p>
DOBIE, J. FRANK. <i>The Voice of the Coyote</i>, Little, Brown, Boston, 1949.
Not only the coyote but his effect on human imagination and ecological
relationships. Natural history and folklore; many tales from factual
trappers as well as from Mexican and Indian folk. This is a strange book
in some ways. If the author had quit at the end of the first chapter,
which is on coyote voicings and their meaning to varied listeners, he
would still have said something. The book includes some, but by no means
all, of the material on the subject in <i>Coyote Wisdom</i> (Publication XIV
of the Texas Folklore Society, 1938) edited by J. Frank Dobie and now
distributed by Southern Methodist University Press, Dallas.
</p>
<p>
GRINNELL, GEORGE BIRD. Wolves and Wolf Nature, in <i>Trail and Camp-Fire</i>,
New York, 1897. This long chapter is richer in facts about the coyote
than anything published prior to <i>The Voice of the Coyote</i>, which
borrows from it extensively.
</p>
<p>
LOFBERG, LILA, and MALCOLMSON, DAVID. <i>Sierra Outpost</i>, Duell, Sloan and
Pearce, New York, 1941. An extraordinary detailment of the friendship
between two people, isolated by snow high in the California Sierras, and
three coyotes. Written with fine sympathy, minute in observations.
</p>
<p>
MATHEWS, JOHN JOSEPH. <i>Talking to the Moon</i>, University of Chicago
Press, 1945. A wise and spiritual interpretation of the black-jack
country of eastern Oklahoma, close to the Osages, in which John Joseph
Mathews lives. Not primarily about coyotes, the book illuminates
them more than numerous books on particular animals illuminate their
subjects.
</p>
<p>
MURIE, ADOLPH. <i>Ecology of the Coyote in the Yellowstone</i>, United States
Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C., 1940. An example of
strict science informed by civilized humanity. <i>The Wolves of Mount
McKinley</i>, United States Government Printing Of ice, Washington, D. C.,
1944. Murie's combination of prolonged patience, science, and sympathy
behind the observations has never been common. His ecological point of
view is steady. Highly interesting reading.
</p>
<p>
YOUNG, STANLEY PAUL (with Edward A. Goldman). <i>The Wolves of North
America</i>, American Wildlife Institute, Washington, D. C., 1944. Full
information, full bibliography, without narrative power. <i>Sketches of
American Wildlife</i>, Monumental Press, Baltimore, 1946. This slight book
contains pleasant chapters on the Puma, Wolf, Coyote, Antelope and other
animals characteristic of the West. (With Hartley H. T. Jackson) <i>The
Clever Coyote</i>, Stackpole, Harrisburg, Pa., and Wildlife Management
Institute, Washington, D. C., 1951. Emphasis upon the economic status
and control of the species, an extended classification of subspecies,
and a full bibliography make this book and Dobie's <i>The Voice of the
Coyote</i> complemental to each other rather than duplicative.
</p>
<center>
PANTHERS
</center>
<p>
Anybody who so wishes may call them mountain lions. Where there were
Negro mammies, white children were likely to be haunted in the night by
fear of ghosts. Otherwise, for some children of the South and West,
no imagined terror of the night equaled the panther's scream. The
Anglo-American lore pertaining to the panther is replete with stories of
attacks on human beings. Indian and Spanish lore, clear down to where W.
H. Hudson of the pampas heard it, views the animal as <i>un amigo de
los cristianos</i>&mdash;a friend of man. The panther is another animal as
interesting for what people associated with him have taken to be facts
as for the facts themselves.
</p>
<p>
BARKER, ELLIOTT S. <i>When the Dogs Barked `Treed'</i>, University of New
Mexico Press, Albuquerque, 1946. Mainly on mountain lions, but firsthand
observations on other predatory animals also. Before he became state
game warden, the author was for years with the United States Forest
Service.
</p>
<p>
HIBBEN, FRANK C. <i>Hunting American Lions</i>, New York, 1948; reprinted
by University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque. Mr. Hibben considers
hunting panthers and bears a terribly dangerous business that only
intrepid heroes like him-self would undertake. Sometimes in this book,
but more awesomely in <i>Hunting American Bears</i>, he manages to out-zane
Zane Grey, who had to warn his boy scout readers and puerile-minded
readers of added years that <i>Roping Lions in the Grand Canyon</i> is true
in contrast to the fictional <i>Young Lion Hunter</i>, which uses some of the
same material.
</p>
<p>
HUDSON, W. H. <i>The Naturalist in La Plata</i>, New York, 1892. A chapter
in this book entitled "The Puma, or Lion of America" provoked an attack
from Theodore Roosevelt (in <i>Outdoor Pastimes of an American Hunter</i>);
but it remains the most delightful narrative-essay yet written on the
subject.
</p>
<p>
YOUNG, STANLEY PAUL, and GOLDMAN, EDWARD A. <i>The Puma, Mysterious
American Cat</i>, American Wildlife Institute, Washington, D. C., 1946.
Scientific, liberal with information of human interest, bibliography.
We get an analysis of the panther's scream but it does not curdle the
blood.

    30. Birds and Wild Flowers
</h2>
<p>
NEARLY EVERYBODY ENJOYS to an extent the singing of birds and the
colors of flowers; to the majority, however, the enjoyment is casual,
generalized, vague, in the same category as that derived from a short
spell of prattling by a healthy baby. Individuals who study birds and
native flora experience an almost daily refreshment of the spirit and
growth of the intellect. For them the world is an unending Garden of
Delight and a hundred-yard walk down a creek that runs through town
or pasture is an exploration. Hardly anything beyond good books, good
pictures and music, and good talk is so contributory to the enrichment
of life as a sympathetic knowledge of the birds, wild flowers, and other
native fauna and flora around us.
</p>
<p>
The books listed are dominantly scientific. Some include keys to
identification. Once a person has learned to use the key for identifying
botanical or ornithological species, he can spend the remainder of his
life adding to his stature.

BEDICHEK, ROY. <i>Adventures with a Texas Naturalist</i> (1947) and
<i>Karankaway Country</i> (1950), Doubleday, Garden City, N. Y. These are
books of essays on various aspects of nature, but nowhere else can one
find an equal amount of penetrating observation on chimney swifts, Inca
doves, swallows, golden eagles, mockingbirds, herons, prairie chickens,
whooping cranes, swifts, scissortails, and some other birds. As Bedichek
writes of them they become integrated with all life.

<p>
BRANDT, HERBERT. <i>Arizona and Its Bird Life</i>, Bird Research Foundation,
Cleveland, 1951. This beautiful, richly illustrated volume of 525 pages
lives up to its title; the birds belong to the Arizona country, and with
them we get pines, mesquites, cottonwoods, John Slaughter's ranch,
the northward-flowing San Pedro, and many other features of the land.
Herbert Brandt's <i>Texas Bird Adventures</i>, illustrated by George Miksch
Sutton (Cleveland, 1940), is more on the Big Bend country and ranch

Dallas, Vol. XXXVIII, No. 1 (Winter, 1953). Maybe some day some man
or woman with means will see the light of civilized patriotism and
underwrite the publication of these great volumes. Patriotism that does
not act to promote the beautiful, the true, and the good had better pipe
down.

SUTTON, GEORGE MIKSCH. <i>Mexican Birds</i>, illustrated with water-color

narrative&mdash;pleasant to read even by one who is not a bird man&mdash;of
discovery in Mexico. To it is appended a resume of Mexican bird life for
the use of other seekers. Sutton's <i>Birds in the Wilderness: Adventures
of an Ornithologist</i> (Macmillan, New York, 1936) contains essays on pet
roadrunners, screech owls, and other congenial folk of the Big Bend
of Texas. <i>The Birds of Brewster County, Texas</i>, in collaboration with
Josselyn Van Tyne, is a publication of the Museum of Zoology, University
of Michigan, University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, 1937.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wild Turkey</i>. Literature on this national bird is enormous. Among books
I name first <i>The Wild Turkey and Its Hunting</i>, by Edward A. McIlhenny,
New York, 1914. OP. McIlhenny was a singular man. His family settled on
Avery Island, Louisiana, in 1832; he made it into a famous refuge for
wild fowls. The memories of individuals of a family long established
on a country estate go back several lifetimes. In two books of Negro
folklore and in <i>The Alligator's Life History</i>, McIlhenny wrote as an
inheritor. Initially, he was a hunter-naturalist, but scientific enough
to publish in the <i>Auk</i> and the <i>Journal of Heredity</i>. Age, desire for
knowledge, and practice in the art of living dimmed his lust for hunting
and sharpened his interest in natural history. His book on the wild
turkey, an extension into publishable form of a manuscript from a
civilized Alabama hunter, is delightful and illuminative reading.
</p>
<p>
<i>The Wild Turkey of Virginia</i>, by Henry S. Mosby and Charles O. Handley,
published by the Commission of Game and Inland Fisheries of Virginia,
Richmond, 1943, is written from the point of view of wild life
management. It contains an extensive bibliography. Less technical is
<i>The American Wild Turkey</i>, by Henry E. Davis, Small Arms Technical
Company, Georgetown, South Carolina, 1949. No strain, or subspecies, of
the wild turkey is foreign to any other, but human blends in J. Stokley
Ligon, naturalist, are unique. The title of his much-in-little book is
<i>History and Management of Merriam's Wild Turkey</i>, New Mexico Game
and Fish Commission, through the University of New Mexico Press,
Albuquerque, 1946.

    31. Negro Folk Songs and Tales
</h2>
<p>
WEST OF A WAVERING line along the western edge of the central parts
of Texas and Oklahoma the Negro is not an important social or cultural
element of the Southwest, just as the modern Indian hardly enters into
Texas life at all and the Mexican recedes to the east. Negro folk songs
and tales of the Southwest have in treatment been blended with those
of the South. Dorothy Scarborough's <i>On the Trail of Negro Folk-Songs</i>
(1925, OP) derives mainly from Texas, but in making up the body of a
Negro song, Miss Scarborough says, "You may find one bone in Texas, one
in Virginia and one in Mississippi." Leadbelly, a guitar player equally
at home in the penitentiaries of Texas and Louisiana, furnished John A.
and Alan Lomax with <i>Negro Folk Songs as Sung by Leadbelly</i>, New York,
1936 (OP). The Lomax anthologies, <i>American Ballads and Folk Songs</i>,
1934, and <i>Our Singing Country</i>, 1941 (Macmillan, New York) and Carl
Sandburg's <i>American Songbag</i> (Harcourt, Brace, New York, 1927) all give
the Negro of the Southwest full representation.
</p>
<p>
Three books of loveliness by R. Emmett Kennedy, <i>Black Cameos</i> (1924),
<i>Mellows</i> (1925), and <i>More Mellows</i> (1931) represent Louisiana Negroes.
All are OP. An excellent all-American collection is James Weldon
Johnson's <i>Book of American Negro Spirituals</i>, Viking, New York, 1940.
Bibliographies and lists of other books will be found in <i>The Negro and
His Songs</i> (1925, OP) and <i>Negro Workaday Songs</i>, by Howard W. Odum and
Guy B. Johnson, University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, 1926,
and in <i>American Negro Folk-Songs</i>, by Newman I. White, Cambridge, 1928.
</p>
<p>
A succinct guide to Negro lore is <i>American Folk Song and Folk Lore: A
Regional Bibliography</i>, by Alan Lomax and Sidney R. Crowell, New York,
1942. OP.
</p>
<p>
Narrowing the field down to Texas, J. Mason Brewer's "Juneteenth,"
in <i>Tone the Bell Easy</i>, Publication X of the Texas Folklore Society,
Austin, 1932, is outstanding as a collection of tales. In volume after
volume the Texas Folklore Society has published collections of Negro
songs and tales A. W. Eddins, Martha Emmons, Gates Thomas, and H. B.
Parks being principal contributors.

    32. Fiction&mdash;Including Folk Tales
</h2>
<p>
FROM THE DAYS of the first innocent sensations in Beadle's Dime Novel
series, on through Zane Grey's mass production and up to any present-day
newsstand's crowded shelf of <i>Ace High</i> and <i>Flaming Guns</i> magazines,
the Southwest, along with all the rest of the West, has been represented
in a fictional output quantitatively stupendous. Most of it has betrayed
rather than revealed life, though not with the contemptible contempt
for both audience and subject that characterizes most of Hollywood's
pictures on the same times, people, and places. Certain historical
aspects of the fictional betrayal of the West may be found in E. Douglas
Branch's <i>The Cowboy and His Interpreters</i>, in <i>The House of Beadle
and Adams and Its Dime and Nickel Novels</i>, by Albert Johannsen in two
magnificent volumes, and in Jay Monaghan's <i>The Great Rascal: The Life
and Adventures of Ned Buntline</i> Buntline having been perhaps the most
prolific of all Wild West fictionists.
</p>
<p>
Some "Westerns" have a kind of validity. If a serious reader went
through the hundreds of titles produced by William McLeod Raine, Dane
Coolidge, Eugene Cunningham,. B. M. Bower, the late Ernest Haycox,
and other manufacturers of range novels who have known their West at
firsthand, he would find, spottedly, a surprising amount of truth about
land and men, a fluency in genuine cowboy lingo, and a respect for the
code of conduct. Yet even these novels have added to the difficulty
that serious writing in the Western field has in getting a hearing on
literary, rather than merely Western, grounds. Any writer of Westerns
must, like all other creators, be judged on his own intellectual
development. "The Western and Ernest Haycox," by James Fargo, in
<i>Prairie Schooner</i>, XXVI (Summer, 1952) has something on this subject.
</p>
<p>
Actualities in the Southwest seem to have stifled fictional creation.
No historical novel dealing with Texas history has achieved the drama of
the fall of the Alamo or the drawing of the black beans, has presented
a character with half the reality of Sam Houston, Jim Bowie, or Sallie
Skull, or has captured the flavor inherent in the talk on many a ranch
gallery.
</p>
<p>
Historical fiction dealing with early day Texas is, however, distinctly
maturing. As a dramatization of Jim Bowie and the bowie knife, <i>The Iron
Mistress</i>, by Paul Wellman (Doubleday, Garden City, New York, 1951),
is the best novel published so far dealing with a figure of the Texas
revolution. In <i>Divine Average</i> (Little, Brown, Boston, 1952), Elithe
Hamilton Kirkland weaves from her seasoned knowledge of life and from
"realities of those violent years in Texas history between 1838 and
1858" a story of human destiny. She reveals the essential nature of
Range Templeton more distinctly, more mordantly, than history
has revealed the essential nature of Sam Houston or any of his
contemporaries. The wife and daughter of Range Templeton are the most
plausible women in any historical novel of Texas that I have read. The
created world here is more real than the actual.
</p>
<p>
Among the early tale-tellers of the Southwest are Jeremiah Clemens, who
wrote <i>Mustang Gray</i>, Mollie E. Moore Davis, of plantation tradition,
Mayne Reid, who dared convey real information in his romances, Charles
W. Webber, a naturalist, and T. B. Thorpe, creator of "The Big Bear of
Arkansas."
</p>
<p>
Fiction that appeared before World War I can hardly be called modern.
No fiction is likely to appear, however, that will do better by certain
types of western character and certain stages of development in western
society than that produced by Bret Harte, with his gamblers; stage
drivers, and mining camps; O. Henry with his "Heart of the West" types;
Alfred Henry Lewis with his "Wolfville" anecdotes and characters; Owen
Wister, whose <i>Virginian</i> remains the classic of cowboy novels without
cows; and Andy Adams, whose <i>Log of a Cowboy</i> will be read as long as
people want a narrative of cowboys sweating with herds.
</p>
<p>
The authors listed below are in alphabetical order. Those who seem to me
to have a chance to survive are not exactly in that order.
</p>
<p>
FRANK APPLEGATE (died 1932) wrote only two books, <i>Native Tales of New
Mexico</i> and <i>Indian Stories from the Pueblos</i>, but as a delighted and
delightful teller of folk tales his place is secure.
</p>
<p>
MARY AUSTIN seems to be settling down as primarily an expositor. Her
novels are no longer read, but the simple tales in <i>One-Smoke Stories</i>
(her last book, 1934) and in some nonfiction collections, notably <i>Lost
Borders</i> and <i>The Flock</i>, do not recede with time.
</p>
<p>
While the Southwest can hardly claim Willa Cather, of Nebraska, her
<i>Death Comes for the Archbishop</i> (1927), which is made out of New
Mexican life, is not only the best-known novel concerned with the
Southwest but one of the finest of America.
</p>
<p>
Despite the fact that it is not on the literary map, Will Levington
Comfort's <i>Apache</i> (1931) remains for me the most moving and incisive
piece of writing on Indians of the Southwest that I have found.
</p>
<p>
If a teller of folk tales and plotless narratives belongs in this
chapter, then J. Frank Dobie should be mentioned for the folk tales in
<i>Coronado's Children, Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver</i>, and <i>Tongues of the
Monte</i>, also for some of his animal tales in <i>The Voice of the Coyote</i>,
outlaw and maverick narratives in <i>The Longhorns</i>, and "The Pacing White
Steed of the Prairies" and other horse stories in <i>The Mustangs</i>.
</p>
<p>
The characters in Harvey Fergusson's <i>Wolf Song</i> (1927) are the Mountain
Men of Kit Carson's time, and the city of their soul is rollicky Taos.
It is a lusty, swift song of the pristine earth. Fergusson's <i>The Blood
of the Conquerors</i> (1931) tackles the juxtaposition of Spanish-Mexican
and Anglo-American elements in New Mexico, of which state he is a
native. <i>Grant of Kingdom</i> (1850) is strong in wisdom life, vitality of
character, and historical values.
</p>
<p>
FRED GIPSON'S <i>Hound-Dog Man</i> and <i>The Home Place</i> lack the critical
attitude toward life present in great fiction but they are as honest and
tonic as creek bottom soil and the people in them are genuine.
</p>
<p>
FRANK GOODWYN'S <i>The Magic of Limping John</i> (New York, 1944, OP) is a
coherence of Mexican characters, folk tales, beliefs, and ways in
the ranch country of South Texas. There is something of magic in the
telling, but Frank Goodwyn has not achieved objective control over
imagination or sufficiently stressed the art of writing.
</p>
<p>
PAUL HORGAN of New Mexico has in <i>The Return of the Weed</i> (short
stories), <i>Far from Cibola</i>, and other fiction coped with modern life in
the past-haunted New Mexico.
</p>
<p>
OLIVER LAFARGE'S <i>Laughing Boy</i> (1929) grew out of the author's
ethnological knowledge of the Navajo Indians. He achieves character.
</p>
<p>
TOM LEA'S <i>The Brave Bulls</i> (1949) has, although it is a sublimation of
the Mexican bullfighting world, Death and Fear of Death for its dominant
theme. It may be compared in theme with Stephen Crane's <i>The Red Badge
of Courage</i>. It is written with the utmost of economy, and is beautiful
in its power. <i>The Wonderful Country</i> (1952), a historical novel of the
frontier, but emphatically not a "Western," recognizes more complexities
of society. Its economy and directness parallel the style of Tom Lea's
drawings and paintings, with which both books are illustrated.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sundown</i>, by John Joseph Mathews (1934), goes more profoundly than
<i>Laughing Boy</i> into the soul of a young Indian (an Osage) and his
people. Its translation of the "long, long thoughts" of the boy and then
of "shades of the prison house" closing down upon him is superb writing.
The "shades of the prison house" come from oil, with all of the world's
coarse thumbs that go with oil.
</p>
<p>
GEORGE SESSIONS PERRY'S <i>Hold Autumn in Your Hand</i> (1941) incarnates
a Texas farm hand too poor "to flag a gut-wagon," but with the good
nature, dignity, and independence of the earth itself. <i>Walls Rise Up</i>
(1939) is a kind of <i>Crock of Gold</i>, both whimsical and earthy, laid on
the Brazos River.
</p>
<p>
KATHERINE ANNE PORTER is as dedicated to artistic perfection as was A.
E. Housman. Her output has, therefore, been limited: <i>Flowering Judas</i>
(1930, enlarged 1935); <i>Pale Horse, Pale Rider</i> (1939), <i>The Leaning
Tower</i> (1944). Her stories penetrate psychology, especially the
psychology of a Mexican hacienda, with rare finesse. Her small canvases
sublimate the inner realities of men and women. She appeals only to
cultivated taste, and to some tastes no other fiction writer in America
today is her peer in subtlety.
</p>
<p>
EUGENE MANLOVE RHODES died in 1934. Most of his novels&mdash;distinguished
by intricate plots and bright dialogue&mdash;had appeared in the <i>Saturday
Evening Post</i>. His finest story is "Paso Por Aqui," published in the
volume entitled <i>Once in the Saddle</i> (1927). Gene Rhodes, who has a
canyon&mdash;on which he ranched&mdash;named for him in New Mexico, was an artist;
at the same time, he was a man akin to his land and its men. He is the
only writer of the range country who has been accorded a biography&mdash;<i>The
Hired Man on Horseback</i>, by May D. Rhodes, his wife. See under "Range
Life."
</p>
<p>
CONRAD RICHTER'S <i>The Sea of Grass</i> (1937) is a kind of prose poem,
beautiful and tragic. Lutie, wife of the owner of the grass, is perhaps
the most successful creation of a ranch woman that fiction has so far
achieved.
</p>
<p>
DOROTHY SCARBOROUGH'S <i>The Wind</i> (1925) excited the wrath of chambers of
commerce and other boosters in West Texas&mdash;a tribute to its realism.
</p>
<p>
<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>, by John Steinbeck (1939), made Okies a word
in the American language. Although dated by the Great Depression, its
humanity and realism are beyond date. It is among the few good novels
produced by America in the first half of the twentieth century.
</p>
<p>
JOHN W. THOMASON, after fighting as a marine in World War I, wrote <i>Fix
Bayonets</i> (1926), followed by <i>Jeb Stuart</i> (1930). A native Texan, he
followed the southern tradition rather than the western. <i>Lone Star
Preacher</i> (1941) is a strong and sympathetic characterization of
Confederate fighting men woven into fictional form.
</p>
<p>
In <i>High John the Conqueror</i> (Macmillan, 1948) John W. Wilson conveys
real feeling for the tragic life of Negro sharecroppers in the Brazos
bottoms. He represents the critical awareness of life that has come
to modern fiction of the Southwest, in contrast to the sterile action,
without creation of character, in most older fiction of the region.

<h2>
    33. Poetry and Drama
</h2>
<p>
"KNOWLEDGE itself is power," Sir Francis Bacon wrote in classical Latin,
and in abbreviated form the proverb became a familiar in households
and universities alike. But knowledge of what? There is no power in
knowledge of mediocre verse.
</p>
<pre>
     I had rather flunk my Wasserman test
     Than read a poem by Edgar A. Guest.
</pre>
<p>
The power of great poetry lies not in knowledge of it but in
assimilation of it. Most talk about poetry is vacuous. Poetry can pass
no power into any human being unless it itself has power&mdash;power
of beauty, truth, wit, humor, pathos, satire, worship, and other
attributes, always through form. No poor poetry is worth reading. Taste
for the best makes the other kind insipid.
</p>
<p>
Compared with America's best poetry, most poetry of the Southwest is as
mediocre as American poetry in the mass is as compared with the great
body of English poetry between Chaucer and Masefield. Yet mediocre
poetry is not so bad as mediocre sculpture. The mediocre in poetry is
merely fatuous; in sculpture, it is ugly. Generations to come will have
to look at Coppini's monstrosity in front of the Alamo; it can't rot
down or burn up. Volumes of worthless verse, most of it printed at the
expense of the versifiers, hardly come to sight, and before long they
disappear from existence except for copies religiously preserved in
public libraries.
</p>
<p>
Weak fiction goes the same way. But a good deal of very bad prose in the
nonfiction field has some value. In an otherwise dull book there may
be a solitary anecdote, an isolated observation on a skunk, a single
gesture of some human being otherwise highly unimportant, one salty
phrase, a side glimpse into the human comedy. If poetry is not good, it
is positively nothing.
</p>
<p>
The earliest poet of historical consequence the only form of his
poetical consequence&mdash;of the Southwest was Mirabeau Buonaparte Lamar. He
led the Texas cavalry at San Jacinto, became president of the Republic
of Texas, organized the futile Santa Fe Expedition, gathered up six
volumes of notes and letters for a history of Texas that might have been
as raw-meat realistic as anything in Zola or Tolstoy. Then as a poet
he reached his climax in "The Daughter of Mendoza"&mdash;a graceful but
moonshiny imitation of Tom Moore and Lord Byron. Perhaps it is better
for the weak to imitate than to try to be original.
</p>
<p>
It would not take one more than an hour to read aloud all the poetry
of the Southwest that could stand rereading. At the top of all I should
place Fay Yauger's "Planter's Charm," published in a volume of the same
title. With it belongs "The Hired Man on Horseback," by Eugene Manlove
Rhodes, a long poem of passionate fidelity to his own decent kind of
men, with power to ennoble the reader, and with the form necessary to
all beautiful composition. This is the sole and solitary piece of poetry
to be found in all the myriads of rhymes classed as "cowboy poetry."
I'd want Stanley Vestal's "Fandango," in a volume of the same title.
Margaret Bell Houston's "Song from the Traffic," which takes one to the
feathered mesquites and the bluebonnets, might come next. Begging pardon
of the perpetually palpitating New Mexico lyricists, I would skip most
of them, except for bits of Mary Austin, Witter Bynner, Haniel Long,
and maybe somebody I don't know, and go to George Sterling's "Father
Coyote"&mdash;in California. Probably I would come back to gallant Phil
LeNoir's "Finger of Billy the Kid," written while he was dying of
tuberculosis in New Mexico. I wouldn't leave without the swift,
brilliantly economical stanzas that open the ballad of "Sam Bass," and
a single line, "He came of a solitary race," in the ballad of "Jesse
James."
</p>
<p>
Several other poets have, of course, achieved something for mortals
to enjoy and be lifted by. Their work has been sifted into various
anthologies. The best one is<i> Signature of the Sun: Southwest Verse,
1900-1950</i>, selected and edited by Mabel Major and T. M. Pearce,
University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, 1950. Two other anthologies
are <i>Songs of the Cattle Trail and Cow Camp</i>, by John A. Lomax, 1919,
reprinted in 1950 by Duell, Sloan and Pearce, New York; <i>The Road to
Texas</i>, by Whitney Montgomery, Kaleidograph, Dallas, 1940. Montgomery's
Kaleidograph Press has published many volumes by southwestern poets.
Somebody who has read them all and has read all the poets represented,
without enough of distillation, in <i>Signature of the Sun</i> could no doubt
be juster on the subject than I am.
</p>
<p>
Like historical fiction, drama of the Southwest has been less dramatic
than actuality and less realistic than real characters. Lynn Riggs of
Oklahoma, author of <i>Green Grow the Lilacs</i>, has so far been the most
successful dramatist.

<h2>
    34. Miscellaneous Interpreters and Institutions
</h2>
<center>
ARTISTS
</center>
<p>
ART MAY BE SUBSTANTIVE, but more than being its own excuse for being,
it lights up the land it depicts, shows people what is significant,
cherishable in their own lives and environments. Thus Peter Hurd of
New Mexico has revealed windmills, Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri has
elevated mules. Nature may not literally follow art, but human eyes
follow art and literature in recognizing nature.
</p>
<p>
The history of art in the Southwest, if it is ever rightly written, will
not bother with the Italian "Holy Families" imported by agent-guided
millionaires trying to buy exclusiveness. It will begin with clay
(Indian pottery), horse hair (vaquero weaving), hide (vaquero plaiting),
and horn (backwoods carving). It will note Navajo sand painting and
designs in blankets.
</p>
<p>
Charles M. Russell's art has been characterized in the chapter on "Range
Life." He had to paint, and the Old West was his life. More versatile
was his contemporary Frederic Remington, author of <i>Pony Tracks, Crooked
Trails</i>, and other books, and prolific illustrator of Owen Wister,
Theodore Roosevelt, Alfred Henry Lewis, and numerous other writers of
the West. Not so well known as these two, but rising in estimation,
was Charles Schreyvogle. He did not write; his best-known pictures
are reproduced in a folio entitled <i>My Bunkie and Others</i>. Remington,
Russell, and Schreyvogle all did superb sculptoring in bronze. One of
the finest pieces of sculpture in the Southwest is "The Seven Mustangs"
by A. Phimister Proctor, in front of the Texas Memorial Museum at
Austin.
</p>
<p>
Among contemporary artists, Ross Santee and Will James (died, 1942) have
illustrated their own cow country books, some of which are listed under
"Range Life" and "Horses." William R. Leigh, author of <i>The Western
Pony</i>, is a significant painter of the range. Edward Borein of Santa
Barbara, California, has in scores of etchings and a limited amount of
book illustrations "documented" many phases of western life. Buck Dunton
of Taos illustrated also. His lithographs and paintings of wild animals,
trappers, cowboys, and Indians seem secure.
</p>
<p>
I cannot name and evaluate modern artists of the Southwest. They are
many, and the excellence of numbers of them is nationally recognized.
Many articles have been written about the artists who during this
century have lived around Taos and painted that region of the Southwest.
Some of the better-known names are Ernest L. Blumenschein, Oscar
Berninghaus, Ward Lockwood, B. J. O. Nordfeldt, Georgia O'Keeffe, Ila
McAfee, Barbara Latham Cook, Howard Cook. Artists thrive in Arizona,
Oklahoma, and Texas as well as in New Mexico. Tom Lea, of El Paso, may
be quitting painting and drawing to spend the remainder of his life in
writing. Perhaps he himself does not know. Jerry Bywaters, who is at
work on the history of art in the Southwest, has about quit producing
to direct the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts. Alexandre Hogue gives
his strength to teaching art in Tulsa University. Exhibitions, not
commentators, are the revealers of art.
</p>
<p>
A few books, all expensive, reproduce the art of certain depicters of
the West and Southwest. <i>Etchings of the West</i>, by Edward Borein, and
<i>The West of Alfred Jacob Miller</i> have been noted in other chapters
(consult Index). Other recent art works are: <i>Peter Hurd: Portfolio of
Landscapes and Portraits</i>, University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque,
1950; <i>Gallery of Western Paintings</i>, edited by Raymond Carlson,
McGraw-Hill, New York, 1951 (unsatisfactory reproduction); <i>Frederic
Remington, Artist of the Old West</i>, by Harold McCracken, Lippincott,
Philadelphia, 1947 (biography and check list with many reproductions);
<i>Portrait of the Old West</i>, by Harold McCracken, McGraw-Hill, New York,
1952 (samplings of numerous artists).
</p>
<p>
In February, 1946, Robert Taft of the University of Kansas began
publishing in the <i>Kansas Historical Quarterly</i> chapters, richly
illustrated in black and white, in "The Pictorial Record of the Old
West." The book to be made from these chapters will have a historical
validity missing in most picture books.
</p>
<center>
MAGAZINES
</center>
<p>
The leading literary magazine of the region is the <i>Southwest Review</i>,
published quarterly at Southern Methodist University, Dallas. The
<i>New Mexico Quarterly</i>, published by the University of New Mexico at
Albuquerque, the <i>Arizona Quarterly</i>, published by the University of
Arizona at Tucson the <i>Colorado Quarterly</i>, published by the University
of Colorado at Boulder, and <i>Prairie Schooner</i>, University of Nebraska
Press, Lincoln, are excellent exponents of current writing in
the Southwest and West. All these magazines are liberated from
provincialism.
</p>
<center>
HISTORICAL SOCIETIES
</center>
<p>
Every state in the Southwest has a state historical organization
that publishes. The oldest and most productive of these, outside of
California, is the Texas State Historical Association, with headquarters
at Austin.
</p>
<center>
HISTORIES
</center>
<p>
A majority of the state histories of the Southwest have been written
with the hope of securing an adoption for school use. It would require
a blacksnake whip to make most juve-niles, or adults either, read these
productions, as devoid of picturesqueness, life-blood, and intellectual
content as so many concrete slabs. No genuinely humanistic history
of the Southwest has ever been printed. There are good factual
histories&mdash;and a history not based on facts can't possibly be good&mdash;but
the lack of synthesis, of intelligent evaluations, of imagination, of
the seeing eye and portraying hand is too evident. The stuff out of
which history is woven&mdash;diaries, personal narratives, county histories,
chronicles of ranches and trails, etc.&mdash;has been better done than
history itself.
</p>
<center>
FOLKLORE
</center>
<p>
Considered scientifically, folklore belongs to science and not to the
humanities. When folk and fun are not scienced out of it, it is song and
story and in literature is mingled with other ingredients of life and
art, as exampled by the folklore in <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>A Midsummer Night's
Dream</i>. In "Indian Culture," "Spanish-Mexican Strains," "Backwoods Life
and Humor," "Cowboy Songs," "The Bad Man Tradition," "Bears," "Coyotes,"
"Negro Folk Songs and Tales," and other chapters of this <i>Guide</i>
numerous books charged with folklore have been listed.
</p>
<p>
The most active state society of its kind in America has been the Texas
Folklore Society, with headquarters at the University of Texas, Austin.
Volume XXIV of its Publications appeared in 1951, and it has published
and distributed other books. Its Publications are now distributed by
Southern Methodist University Press in Dallas. J. Frank Dobie, with
constant help, was editor from 1922 to 1943, when he resigned. Since
1943 Mody C. Boatright has been editor.
</p>
<p>
In 1947 the New Mexico Folklore Society began publishing yearly the <i>New
Mexico Folklore Record</i>. It is printed by the University of New Mexico
Press. The University of Arizona, Tucson, has published several folklore
bulletins. The California Folklore Society publishes, through the
University of California Press, Berkeley, <i>Western Folklore</i>, a
quarterly. In co-operation with the Southeastern Folklore Society, the
University of Florida, Gainesville, publishes the <i>Southern Folklore
Quarterly</i>. Levette J. Davidson of the University of Denver, author
of <i>A Guide to American Folklore</i>, University of Denver Press, 1951,
directs the Western Folklore Conference. The <i>Journal of American
Folklore</i> has published a good deal from the Southwest and Mexico. The
Sociedad Folklorica de Mexico publishes its own <i>Anurio</i>. Between 1929
and 1932, B. A. Botkin, editor of <i>A Treasury of Southern Folklore</i>,
1949, and A <i>Treasury of Western Folklore</i>, 1951 (Crown, New York),
brought out four volumes entitled <i>Folk-Say</i>, University of Oklahoma
Press. OP. The volumes are significant for literary utilizations of
folklore and interpretations of folks.

MUSEUMS

<p>
Museums do not belong to the DAR. Their perspective on the past is
constructive. The growing museums in Santa Fe, Tucson, Phoenix, Tulsa,
Oklahoma City, Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, Austin, Denver, and on west
into California represent the art, fauna, flora, geology, archeology,
occupations, transportation, architecture, and other phases of the
Southwest in a way that may be more informing than many printed volumes.

<h2>
    35. Subjects for Themes
</h2>
<p>
THE OBJECT OF THEME-WRITING is to make a student observe, to become
aware, to evaluate, to enrich himself. Any phase of life or literature
named or suggested in the foregoing chapters could be taken as a subject
for an essay. The most immature essay must be more than a summary; a
mere summary is never an essay. The writer must synthesize, make his own
combination of thoughts, facts, incidents, characteristics, anecdotes,
interpretations, illustrations, according to his own pattern. A writer
is a weaver, weaving various threads of various hues and textures into a
design that is his own.
</p>
<p>
"Look into thy heart and write." "Write what you know about." All this
is good advice in a way&mdash;but students have to write themes whether they
have anything to write or not. The way to get full of a subject, to
generate a conveyable interest, is to fill up on the subject. As clouds
are but transient forms of matter that "change but cannot die," so
most writing, even the best, is but a variation in form of experiences,
ideas, observations, emotions that have been recorded over and over.
</p>
<p>
In general, the materials a student weaves are derived from three
sources: what he has read, what he has heard, what he has observed and
experienced himself. If he chooses to sketch an interesting character,
he will make his sketch richer and more interesting if he reads all he
can find that illuminates his subject's background. If he sets out to
tell a legend or a series of related folk tales or anecdotes, he will
improve his telling by reading what he can on the subjects that his
proposed narratives treat of and by reading similar narratives
already written by others. If he wishes to tell what he knows about
rattlesnakes, buzzards, pet coyotes, Brahma cattle, prickly pear,
cottonwoods, Caddo Lake, the Brazos River, Santa Fe adobes, or other
features of the land, let him bolster and put into perspective his own
knowledge by reading what others have said on the matter. Knowledge
fosters originality. Reading gives ideas.
</p>
<p>
The list of subjects that follows is meant to be suggestive, and must
not be regarded as inclusive. The best subject for any writer is one
that he is interested in. A single name or category may afford scores
of subjects. For example, take Andy Adams, the writer about cowboys and
range life. His campfire yarns, the attitude of his cowboys toward their
horses, what he has to say about cows, the metaphor of the range as he
has recorded it, the placidity of his cowboys as opposed to Zane Grey
sensationalism, etc., are a few of the subjects to be derived from a
study of his books. Or take a category like "How the Early Settlers
Lived." Pioneer food, transportation, sociables, houses, neighborliness,
loneliness, living on game meat, etc., make subjects. Almost every
subject listed below will suggest either variations or associated
subjects.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
